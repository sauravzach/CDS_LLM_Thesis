we broke up because i couldn't take it anymore.	distorted	1

i constantly have 2 different thoughts and i argue with myself all the time in my head.	distorted	1
whatever, anything so that i don't have to suffer anymore.	distorted	1
my wife feels very stressed whenever i try to talk to her about it (her distress has been kept latent too long, because my mother – a midwife thought it was ocd).	distorted	1
i don't know what to do because i love him, but i just keep having such bad thoughts about him.	distorted	1
she thinks i should see a therapist, but it really scares me and makes me uncomfortable to be honest.	distorted	1
i feel completely lost in life, i don't know what i want.	distorted	1
also because i love him, but now i'm so lost and confused i'm tired of being hurt! why should i be punished with heart break because hes still not ready to commit.	distorted	1
i have been married before at 19 for only 3 months and i thought i was over it and didnt care.	distorted	1
at present i feel as if i could disappear and no one would notice.	distorted	1
i started to realize this only recently but since the beginning i found myself feeling more and more stressed and afraid to do something wrong and i start to feel less and less confident about myself.	distorted	1
i feel like i'm just being weak or pathetic because i cannot think of any reason for me to have depression, but whatever it is is really wearing me down, and making me very unproductive and unsocial.	distorted	1
he's never really dealt with his emotions about his past, although he is a sensitive guy and i know he has a lot of hurt inside him.	distorted	1

i have been dealing with my anxiety for years i never knew how to control the stupid mental illness.	distorted	1
where to start? my #1 problem right now is i seem to have a huge,massive, paralyzing fear of the mail & bills.	distorted	1
none of our fights are ever about one another, yet they can become so mean due to my anger.	distorted	1
i have also have thoughts that i may have a psychosis disorder because i am extremely worried i may turn into a psycho and hurt someone which i know i don't want to do that.	distorted	1
what does it mean, when you are completely exhausted, but have no desire to go to sleep? i have searched everywhere, and no one seems to have posted something regarding this issue.	distorted	1
my thoughts are always riddled with what is wrong with me? i question self worth and i loath my self because i'm not good enough.	distorted	1
my dad wanted me to pull out but i insisted on going back because i knew i didn't fail for the reasons he thought i did.	distorted	1
my mother and i constantly fight, and i'm never the one to start it.	distorted	1
i feel so awful about myself because i think it is inevitable that i feel i have done something to cause it.	distorted	1
i have tried to help her but she has to do it herself, if i try she just gets more angry.	distorted	1
i've been prescribed antidepressants and anti psychotic but never took them cause my mom n older sister doesn't take me to get the message cause they think refuse to understand me.	distorted	1
however, if i am alone i become certain that i am a failure and will never be able to meet my standards.	distorted	1
my childhood, family, and friendships were and are normal, but i do not have emotional connections to anyone; if somebody 'close' to me died, i would only be concerned with how it would affect my own convenience.	distorted	1
everyday we fight because i have something bad to say.	distorted	1
i've had this problem for quite a while now but, i'm too embarrassed to share it with anyone because i don't want anyone to think that i'm some kind of weird person.	distorted	1
a lot of my relatives thought i should join the military but now i'm way too overweight and i honestly don't think i'd be able to handle the stress of being in the military anyway.	distorted	1
should i divorce in hopes of feeling relief and new love? should i stay where i am because things are horrible and breaking up the family would be worse? i am terrified of making the wrong decision.	distorted	1
it's not like i have thought about marriage or anything like that, i understand that i'm only 21.	distorted	1
she feels that the only way to get away from the hurt is to leave me.	distorted	1
i am still as lost as ever, desperate for guidance, please :( i have had bulimia/ednos since i was 14 (6 years) and have been through periods of severe self harm in order to cope with it.	distorted	1

if i'm in a rut or maybe stuck in traffic or in a situation where i'm not completely sure what to do, i freak out and get very frustrated and angry.	distorted	1
"i'm a 34 year old male and for many years i went through phases where i was very hard on myself, no matter what i achieved, i would still tell myself that its not good enough and pretty much destroy any sort of ""good feelings"" that i assume come with such things."	distorted	1
he was completely psychotic in this time, he actually thought i was someone else and threatened to kill me.	distorted	1
after we talk everything over he always says sorry he didn't mean it he was just angry and so on.	distorted	1
i'm desperate for any advice!! please help a helpless confused soul before i lose my mind for good.	distorted	1

i do not feel welcome nor safe much at home.	distorted	1
"but he said i didn't have to get him a present because he'd feel guilty because i'd be ""wasting money"" on a bad person."	distorted	1
while i didn't have the worst childhood i prefer not to think about it.	distorted	1

what should i do? my last year is next year and i want to focus on myself and my grades but it is difficult when society is in the way.	distorted	1
i had a chronic feeling of emptiness it seems it will never go.	distorted	1

my mind never seems to drift away from over-analyzing any small part of my day that may be related to some sort of symptom of a disorder (such as overreacting to any thoughts that don't seem to be mine kind of thing).	distorted	1

i have full access to everything including phones etc so i know he isn't cheating.	distorted	1
i have problems with severe anxiety, i tend to feel more comfortable staying in by myself and so that i don't have to interact with others.	distorted	1
i have never been good enough and it caused me to want to take out my anger on others.	distorted	1
do you think it is possible to move on past this and be a family or do i just run for the hills? could it have been his state of mind at the time? i'm so confused whether or not to try to make this work.	distorted	1
i wanted to be a doctor but how can i with all these problems? my dreams were torn apart when i was 11, i don't know where i belong.	distorted	1
i know if i break up with him, i wont be able to move on but if i stay with him, i can't live with the fact that he doesn't even bother communicating with me.	distorted	1
my dad has always demanded so much of me that it ended up draining me and sending down a spiral of depression, ocd, eating disorders and suicidal thoughts.	distorted	1
when i think of quitting, i cry, because the thought of leaving all the nice people who work there makes me sad.	distorted	1
he won't tell me specifically what i do (if it's me) that bothers him no matter how i ask.	distorted	1
but he ignore me so my mom got his number from my phone and text him behind my back and i over reacted becuz i never got that close to a guy.	distorted	1
do i have anxiety? and what can i do about it? i want to talk to people about it but i feel silly and childish.	distorted	1
i know he enjoys sex with me but he can never seem to to last and if its not that he just doesn't want to be touched so attempting to even initiate something ends up making me feel completely rejected.	distorted	1
i dont know why but i feel like i am going to die.	distorted	1
and he's either cruel to me to the point of my fighting back, or ignored anything i say completely.	distorted	1
from a 16 year old girl in india: i am having lots of problems being with my father that i think of hurting him and that i will never have my own life.	distorted	1
"my main question is ""how do i stop hating my step children?"" i can't control my anger every time they are even around."	distorted	1
it became a toxic dance & my self-esteem suffered.	distorted	1
but i've told a few friends to fuck off or that i hate them, which i don't! i'm also sad so often of the time and i feel like nobody wants me around and that i'm worthless.	distorted	1
i feel as if the more i express myself, the more frightened i am to express myself, and i think it's all because of what i did when i was in middle school.	distorted	1
is that normal to have thoughts and images pop up like that? my worst fear is that ill end up crazy or schizophrenic.	distorted	1
i start to feel that the only way to get the feeling to stop is to hurt someone but i know it's wrong so i try to hold back.	distorted	1
from a teen in switzerland: i want to live my life without all of the negative thoughts and worries.	distorted	1
but he's also expressed suicidal thoughts in the past in the context of never wanting to go back to prison, and he's become worn out and depressed in dealing with the system (frequent court hearings, probation officers, in-laws, etc.	distorted	1
i feel like it's unacceptable to ignore someone at their worst as i was there for him at his worst.	distorted	1
the thought of going to university at this point terrifies me as i am worrying that all of my problems will get worse and worse to the point that i can't cope anymore.	distorted	1
and sometimes i remember events from my childhood -5 to 7 years old- and feel bad and worthless *as a kid.	distorted	1
it's gotten to the point where i won't even help my mom cook because it always terrifies me when my mom cuts meat.	distorted	1
no, i am not going to suicide and never tried that but i kinda feel like it is going to be a traffic accident or someone will kill me.	distorted	1
i feel awful, inferior, useless and worthless.	distorted	1
let me start by saying that i am an 18 years old hetero male and i am suffering from these thoughts for 2 years.	distorted	1
i am going mad because since 13 i have only gotten maybe 10 hours of sleep a week.	distorted	1
i have never felt like this before and don't understand why i feel this way now, but a few things that he has said and done over the years has really stuck in my head and now that my daughter is becoming a woman i am worried.	distorted	1
i blow up at my children when they ask me to do something, i'm easily annoyed, its hard for me to have a gathering at my house because the anxiety gets too out of control if i have to make coffee, have snacks or even a conversation without getting up and walking around aimlessly to do something, i dont know what.	distorted	1
he's perhaps the only person that knows everything about me–i told him about my depression, he obviously knows about the prostitution–but he uses it against me when we have arguments.	distorted	1
i hated him more, because my mother died of giving birth and here he is having a new wife.	distorted	1
from india: i have a bad relationship with my mother.	distorted	1
the psychologist told me i was having problems because i was so unstablyouith living circumstances.	distorted	1
i have to drown it out with music or podcasts to drown out my thoughts.	distorted	1

i used to be a volcano trying to erupt under ice, but now i'm a car that won't stop running, and the only thing that keeps me going is adrenaline.	distorted	1
it's humiliating and is uncomfortable for everyone involved.	distorted	1
i yell at my son that is 2years old and i hate myself for that cause he doesnt know better.	distorted	1
and now i'm here, failing the 9th grade, completely friendless, i'm on medications and i'm going to therapy but i still can't get my life together.	distorted	1
the problem is he never wants to go anywhere with my children and me.	distorted	1
i don't recognize the voice, i think it's inner but it's affecting me sometimes in a bad way.	distorted	1
i'm tired of crying about pointless things and never knowing what to do.	distorted	1
my siblings and i have always thought he was semi-unstable, but recently he's gotten much worse.	distorted	1
i kept my feelings to myself because i didn't want my family to worry.	distorted	1
this may not sound like much but i feel so depressed and i try, i really do, i just don't know why i don't get things in return.	distorted	1
by hurting i mean only pinching, or slapping or scratching (basically anything that can make them suffer and cry a bit) but i don't feel any greater harm.	distorted	1
my mother went through a terrible depression in her early 40's.	distorted	1
it was my way of curbing my depressive episodes and the suicidal thoughts that never cease haunting me.	distorted	1
i have noticed that my emotions are starting to ignore everything.	distorted	1
i didn't know what to do because i feared i would lose my job and make things even worse.	distorted	1
i have also insulin resistance and tachycardia (they are aware), so i don't want to trouble them with something as big as depression and anxiety that may just be all up in my head and possibly not be true.	distorted	1
i feel like if im living in this house with someone who sees me a certain way and accuses me of being someone im not, the only way out is to kill myself.	distorted	1
i have always been suicidal so i can't relate to him.	distorted	1
when i asked them about it, they said that they had: – a weird want to hurt people that they do not know.	distorted	1
i have been diagnosed with major depression with psychosis truth is however i'm faking it because i am afraid to tell the truth which is i have no feelings toward people.	distorted	1
i was devastated because i never ever thought something like this could happen.	distorted	1
i grew up with my parents thinking i was lazy and had no motivation of doing anything but that wasn't the case they just didn't know that i was just hiding the way i was feeling from them because i knew they wouldn't understand.	distorted	1
well according to what my aunt said they knew eachother for only 2 months or so b4 they got married! the story started when i heard my mom sweet talking on the phone, i first panicked & when i asked her who it was she said juss a friend but i knew she was lying .	distorted	1
starting from last year he's been undergoing ever more increasing depression.	distorted	1
i haven't told no one because i know they will say i am stupid for doing it.	distorted	1
i had a very traumatic childhood being given up by my mum who couldn't look after me for her own mental problems which i still hate her for deep down, in and out of care all my life.	distorted	1
this makes me sad because i don't want to be the cause of someone's unhappiness and i know i need help.	distorted	1
the problem i am having (which was also around before we got married) is that my wife continuously gets mad at me for reasons (in her perspective) that have to do with my not being caring enough, not understanding her, not being willing to listen to her.	distorted	1
"he repeatedly punched and broke my dashboard in my vehicle while screaming ""shutup you stupid b*tch!!"" when i told him once that he should go easier on his father when they had a disagreement."	distorted	1
who am i? why the hell do i feel so disconnected from everything… including myself? i can't sleep at night because i can't shake these questions out of my mind… and when i do sleep, the same questions haunt me in my nightmares… i'm lost….	distorted	1
i see a therapist and i don't really think that is helping much, partly because i find it so difficult to talk to anyone about this stuff let alone people i don't know very well and because i find it hard to expresses the such strong feelings of sadness, self hatred and guilt that i feel.	distorted	1
to clarify it's nothing sexual, i don't engage in that sort of behavior, and i still feel unhappy over negative attention- but i enjoy that feeling of unhappiness.	distorted	1
s: ever since i can remember, i have had people telling me to sit down and stop fidgeting.	distorted	1
i have no reason to be this neurotic because there isn't a diagnosable mental illness i can have and i cant think back to any past trauma that might have caused it but its driving me crazy and i feel like this has to stop now because its so frivolous and ridiculous.	distorted	1
he's a great guy who never got angry at me or furious because of my ocd (afraid of germs), he was supporting and even changed his behavior in public to avoid me having a panic attack.	distorted	1
i stopped eating and no one even came to check on me.	distorted	1
i nag and nitpick over every little thing and he feels horrible because there isn't anything he can do about it.	distorted	1
i am just constantly afraid of failing and just never feel like i am good enough.	distorted	1
whenever i have to leave my house i start to feel sick.	distorted	1
it feels like i am constantly on the verge of a complete panic attack.	distorted	1
"he is sometimes inappropriate with his flirting, and when i talk with some of the girls he knows, he asks me ""what we talked about,"" and now i'm paranoid that he's hiding things from me."	distorted	1
i'll think a shadow is a moving bug, and once i thought i saw smoke in the dining room, but nothing was cooking or on fire.	distorted	1
i can't speak my mind, i feel i can't ask for anything because i'm bothering people.	distorted	1
she obviously get's angry and disappointed with me because i don't want to eat.	distorted	1
i'm not diagnosed with anything, my mom says depression is a phase every teenage girl goes through and that it will just past me.	distorted	1
faking is impossible because i don't understand what or how to do it since i don't understand what is appropriate.	distorted	1
every single time something happens now, he will cut himself, snort pills, and threaten to kill himself, or repeatedly ask me if he can die or how he should kill himself.	distorted	1
i find myself wanting to binge on alcohol often and it's a struggle to stop at 1 glass ever, even though i hate feeling drunk.	distorted	1
she never wanted him, she just went along with it but now knows she was duped and i feel so angry and hateful.	distorted	1
recently, i have been stressed which has caused what symptoms of anxiety i have to skyrocket.	distorted	1
now when she gets angry at our parrot for making a mess or being too loud, she hits the cage but never the bird.	distorted	1
when i was little i couldn't watch the news because i would become upset and always think about the people who died.	distorted	1
i am a shy (male) senior student in high school unsure of my plans of what to do in college and how to get a scholarship in the art world.	distorted	1
i saw john cena, followed him, and came to a huge nest of killer bees; he was riding a four-wheeler and was making the bees mad.	distorted	1
i guess it is an anxiety attack.	distorted	1
but i do do the following: worry a lot, become concerned that people don't like me or are talking about me even though i know its irrational and makes no sense all of this worsened after my recent move.	distorted	1
i was and am completely furious.	distorted	1
we have always suspected that it was more than pms, she's practically an alcoholic and her behaviour isn't cyclical as you would suspect from pms.	distorted	1
i feel more isolated than ever and just have aching loneliness.	distorted	1
he will question me on everything and i have to prove everything he has doubt in.	distorted	1
i think someone says my name or whispers but no one did.	distorted	1
i would go outside and smoke at 3 am in the morning, the parking lot was empty, would still hear them, but, no one was there.	distorted	1
ever since i can remember, starting from when my mom and dad got divorced, i was ill treated by my relatives on my mother's side.	distorted	1
i am too scared to sleep now because i'm afraid that one day i might not wake up in time and will die in my sleep.	distorted	1
i lied and gave him a very low number, because i knew he was a jealous man.	distorted	1
i became depressed, i wouldn't have an appetite, i would get bad grades, and i would sleep all the time.	distorted	1
drawing is one of the only things i can do where my head isn't a buzz with disaster scenariorizing.	distorted	1
it all started with losing sleep the night before an exam and had very severe negative thoughts later.	distorted	1
it has gotten to the point where life has been complete hell and the only solution i can think of is violence (i won't go into detail).	distorted	1
but to me, if i don't = i will fail.	distorted	1
i genuinely don't think i could ever hurt her, she is the most important thing in the world to me.	distorted	1
my parents have done so much for me, and i know they have tried their best at raising me, but, i can't help but blame them for how i turned out and feel angry at them.	distorted	1
should he be looked at? usually my son will throw tantrums that we feel are normal for a 5 year old.	distorted	1
i have felt pretty good without the meds but here latley i am back to crying for no reason and only able to think about what needs to be done instead of doing it.	distorted	1
im annoying and i should be alone forever.	distorted	1
"i never knew he felt so disgusted with me that he would describe my having children as ""shitting out kids"" to other people when he talks to them."	distorted	1
that night i cried myself to sleep because i was scared i didn't understand what was going on with my brother or if he was going to be okay.	distorted	1
i have thoughts that i may be making up my problems to get attention or that nothing's wrong with me because some days everything feels normal but 90% of the time i feel horrible(memory problems,lack of purpose,difficulty concentrating,worrying,slightly suicidal).	distorted	1
killing myself often crossed my mind and i also had thoughts of violence, not only directed at myself, but at other people as well.	distorted	1
i also hate it when we have to give a presentation for class.	distorted	1
i never found my behavior weird until i was put on anti depressants.	distorted	1
it's gotten to the point where i doubt everything i thought i once knew about myself.	distorted	1
i thought it was all my fault, even if i'd been told it wasn't.	distorted	1
and im afraid because i know how bad i feel, and i dont want to be locked away forever.	distorted	1
but i feel like anytime he gets upset with me or we have an argument and he goes out with his friends, i fear he would hurt me again.	distorted	1
i'd rather stay in my room away from everyone, even my own family but now it's starting to bother them.	distorted	1
i only have fragments of memories of being abused as a kid.	distorted	1
the other night she came in and was mad that she couldn't be beside her dad because i was, so she whjned and punched me in the back until i left.	distorted	1
she's always stressed and has to deal with my two brothers who both have issues and are seeing therapists which are expensive and we don't have a lot of money.	distorted	1
looking back on our courtship, i can see a few warning signs that i wasn't mature enough to recognize at the time, but he never acted quite this rageful towards me in the past.	distorted	1
from france: i have contacted you because my boyfriend started to see a psychotherapist since last autumn and i was skeptical from the start but i couldn't forbid him this.	distorted	1
when it is at its worst, i can hardly get out a rational thought, it just keeps building on itself.	distorted	1
empathy is difficult for me, i find that i have to force emotions out of myself to at least appear sane to others.	distorted	1
i broke up with him a few weeks after our 1 year because i couldn't take the struggles anymore, and he was physically sick.	distorted	1
"also, because she and her soon to be ex-husband always had trouble living life as ""adults"" should and could never get and keep a place to live."	distorted	1
i sat in my mothers living room at one time screaming and crying while home alone because i was surrounded by fire.	distorted	1
"it's not like i'm gonna just come out and say, ""i want to go back to my therapist because i want to hurt people,"" because then i don't know what would happen."	distorted	1
i would never hurt a fly let alone act on these thoughts but i wanna know why i'm having them? i heard it's from ocd and anxiety, and i know i have anxiety.	distorted	1
i worry that if he doesn't get help soon he will do something silly as he just hates his life and feels he is a complete failure, i find it difficult to help him as i disagree with what he is blaming his problems on.	distorted	1
i then got on depression medication again because i did not want to live that life style anymore.	distorted	1
i'd never feel like that, if i wasn't guilt-tripping myself, but in that moment, suicide seems like a pretty good idea – because i will feel like i'm unworthy of living because of all my screw-ups and like it'd keep me from screwing up again or from hurting someone else ever again.	distorted	1
i've always got a headache, or stomach ache, or just generally feel ill.	distorted	1
she's often pessimistic and only thinks about how thing's effect her.	distorted	1
first off i haven't killed anyone yet because i'm not stupid.	distorted	1
i feel like i have always suffered from depression but i'm not 100% sure.	distorted	1
while my dad, of course, is not completely innocent my mom seems to be having mental problems that are the basis for the arguing.	distorted	1
i don't know what do i exactly feel but it always pricks me, makes me want to cry and then it leads to making me feel useless because whatever i try to do ends up wrong.	distorted	1
in 22 years, i still have only had maybe a dozen memories of my childhood prior to the accident.	distorted	1
i don't understand that since i am 41, my brother should have no say in what i do and don't do with my money, but when i try to tell him, he gets all mad at me and says that i am selfish.	distorted	1
he is good-looking and has an amazing personality but even thinking about meeting him or having a relationship with him makes me sick not because of him…because of me and i regret registering to the site.	distorted	1
everything's been a mess now and she's changed so much.	distorted	1
this is killing me because i don't want to be with anybody else! he is all i think of and the only man i want to ever be with.	distorted	1
half the time my mom would wait til he left the kitchen then throw it away, then they'd fight about it all the time.	distorted	1
i am afraid if this continues i might lose needing my mom in my life ever which i feel guilty about.	distorted	1
"with each new, horrible thing he says to me, i think to myself ""this is the last straw, i will not put up with this anymore."	distorted	1
and i'm the worse iv ever been.	distorted	1
of course i was told i was a horrible mother for even thinking of asking him to leave.	distorted	1
her father was always drunk and she witnessed him beat her brothers because he was jealous that his wife (my mom's mother) was paying too much attention to them.	distorted	1
i have always had a fear of death, after when i was little we lost one of the family pets (we treat them more like family members) and ever since then i have had these strange, at random, panics about me dying, and that i just don't want my story to end.	distorted	1
i can't stand the thought of being fat again especially because i know how hard it was for my old horse to carry me around when i was overweight and every time i reach a goal weight i set another that's less.	distorted	1
it's sending me in fits of hysteria!! in the mornings i don't want to get up because i'm afraid of being stressed out.	distorted	1
i haven't told my therapist about this because i don't know if it's just my anxiety or if i actually have the disorder.	distorted	1
i feel bad because i thought i'm all he ever wants and dreamed of but it doesn't feel that way.	distorted	1
he told me when we broke up that when he thinks about his future, he doesn't see me in it anymore, and as much as he wanted us to work he just can't do it anymore.	distorted	1
i often question why i do anything, i have no energy, nor motivation to do anything, i'm never hungry, i just feel weird and i always have a headache.	distorted	1
this started a couple of months ago when i bought a whole new wardrobe which i needed because i have lost 77 pounds in the last year.	distorted	1
he doesn't blame me for the issues any more and actually admits to the manipulation and abuse.	distorted	1
i quit trying to talk to him about my hurt feelings because i feared it would just make him withdraw more, and possibly end the relationship.	distorted	1
i feel so bad because i'm an awful friend for wanting to drop her but i just don't want to talk about mental illness.	distorted	1
it's not a body image thing it's more i feel like a dick doing it and it seems very contrived & superficial but the only one suffering as a result of not doing it is me.	distorted	1
all i ever think about is dying but i think i'm getting worse.	distorted	1
if my shoes feel weird, if i can't find something, just setting up my computer, or for no reason at all, can cause me to become irritated.	distorted	1
she was in a bad place with her family dealing with a lot of anxiety, depression and emotional issues.	distorted	1
i feel very depressed and worthless.	distorted	1
i cannot get my therapists to focus of the pstd problems (flashbacks and nigtmares and severe anxiety) and they want me on an anti-psychotic even though there's never been any hint of a problem with the paxil setting off the bipolar.	distorted	1
i always thought if i try harder it will be better, but with me my mistakes remind the same.	distorted	1
after the bad experience he got into alot of trouble and i feel that he hates me now because i told the police on him.	distorted	1
at the age of 25 i approached my ob/gyn about mood swings and lack of sexual drive and she prescribed me zoloft for post partum because my youngest daughter was about 8 months old.	distorted	1
sometime i am good but sometimes suddenly it comes back and i have panic attacks or very anxious time.	distorted	1
what if i just masked it? i feel completely empty, i feel so unloved.	distorted	1
what is your advice on what i should do if i ever come face to face with him at the gym again? ignore him and leave? i have done some research and think this man may have borderline personality disorder.	distorted	1
it's all caused me so much pain.	distorted	1
in our second year he was diagnosed with a severe depression that he must have had for a while then.	distorted	1
i can't stop lying about everything.	distorted	1
ever since i was about 15 i have struggled with ever-worsening depression to the point where i was frequently self-harming and not moving for days.	distorted	1
this has made all my self-loathing and guiltiness and embarrassment worse and i feel like i'm failing academically and also failing as a person.	distorted	1
all complete with the thoughts that if i didn't, something bad would happen.	distorted	1
it was crippling anxiety my family had no idea what to do and neither did i.	distorted	1
i have a broken hip, my own fault, when i told her she cried and said she would come to the hospital immediately then talked only about her relationship for 45 minutes and didn't come.	distorted	1
me and my stepdad has nicknamed it broken mirror disorder because my problem doesn't match mpd because i don't have amnesia and i'm aware of everything i do, i thought it was a split personality but my mom says it's not split personality disorder.	distorted	1
when i'm in school i think i'm doing just fine then get a letter saying i need to take summer school because i failed my classes.	distorted	1
it scares me to think that i'm only 13 and i am having these types of dark thoughts.	distorted	1
"if i smell something bad, or something i dont like, i have to ""push out"" the bad scent out of my nose three times and breathe in ""good smells"" once or twice."	distorted	1
from that moment i felt shame hit the drugs and the streets, constant rejected and scapegoated by family, then at other times used as the parents only source of support.	distorted	1
my theropiet my i was a teen said that she thinks i didn't cry because i knew no one would come anyway.	distorted	1
this isnt just a lovers tiff, it is a life threatening situation and i have no support and no indication of what i should do and, more importantly, what i should not do.	distorted	1
i'm never happy about any of my achievements and i think nothing is important in my life.	distorted	1
and i lie awake at night thinking about it and how i never wanted it and i should have just cried or kept saying no.	distorted	1
i hate myself because i'm different.	distorted	1
i hated them and wanted nothing to do with them and tried to suppress them, but was convinced i was evil.	distorted	1
i can't have sex when i'm sober, because i have horrible anxiety that i am doing everything wrong.	distorted	1
i can't stop, i think about rape all the time, it's always in the back of my mind, and whenever i hear about a rape scene in a movie, i look it up right away, even though i know that doing so will hurt me.	distorted	1
first i was ok with it then became very anxious of all that happened, i couldn't sleep and became very tired.	distorted	1
my boyfriend's mother seemed to like me at first but since he and i have moved in together she has been my worst enemy.	distorted	1
but pain and tears never stop.	distorted	1
i don't feel able to talk to anyone about this because i know it makes me seem immature, but i want to stop these behaviours to give my parents a bit of a break.	distorted	1
we were never allowed to be sad, or mad, or anything else that wasn't happy.	distorted	1
i also haven't been able to tell her that i feel so angry or depressed, because i think she may think that i have no reason for such feeling/thinking and it was my choice to be like this (this is what my mom believes and tells me).	distorted	1
nothing has resolved my depression.	distorted	1
my mom is a single parent,my dad died when i was only 6 months old.	non-distorted	0
it sounds so irresponsible, spoiled, and childish which is why it's so hard for me to talk about because i can't convey the way it feels to me inside.	distorted	1
"i didn't know that was putting ""me"" on the side to give what others wanted; ultimately a bad move."	distorted	1
he is also completely paranoid and accuses people of being out to get him.	distorted	1
he didn't ever force me, just bribed, so was it still sexual abuse? or was it at first, and then it became consensual at some point when i knew more? and how unusual is this, and does it mean something's wrong with me? sometimes i think there's something wrong with me when i think back on it.	distorted	1
well, yes it is stress because i do not feel like myself for half of each month and am ruining my relationships with my unexplained depression and lashing anger.	distorted	1
i am a 35 year old woman and going through a depressing phase of my life.	distorted	1
i am completely alone, no family and few uninvolved friends, so my state of mood never affects anyone.	distorted	1
he's broken up with me on numerous ocassions because he can't handle my always acussing him of things i have.	distorted	1
i have no reason to want this, i am not bullied, nor is there anyone i outright hate and want to make dead.	distorted	1
it is obvious that my father is causing a lot of distress but there is nothing we could do about it, we can't ask him to return to where he'd come from because he is very ill and cannot take care of himself, he has no where else to go.	distorted	1
i wasnt brought up in a abusive family and i have never had a traumatised childhood.	non-distorted	0
i'm always sad, i could be happy for one minute then back to sad.	distorted	1
now i'm fat i do everything but i can lose some weight everyday my weight is changing.	distorted	1
will he ever hurt me? he bought a gun recently and this really puts me on edge.	distorted	1
i don't know what to do, i want to talk to her but this never happened before so i'm kind of scared, i don't know how she's going to react.	distorted	1
i'm honestly trying my best to be a better person but no matter how much i try, these negative thoughts and feelings won't go away.	distorted	1
for months i kept thinking i had something wrong with my brain, because i would have constant headaches and intrusive thoughts and the paranoia/anxiety over everything.	distorted	1
i cut myself about 10 times each night on my hips where no one can see and i tend to find myself crying for no reason.	distorted	1
the problem is that now that i never play it anymore i feel a very strong need to play it and since no other game can replace it i feel unhappy and unfulfilled.	distorted	1
i have never had a job and i want one, and i want to go back to school, but i'm so terrified of my anxiety and depression and paranoia getting in the way.	distorted	1
next, i have trouble concentrating and communicating with my fiance and family because my head is so cluttered with thoughts.	distorted	1
i can't help but think i'm going to be like this for the rest of my life, miserable, and pathetic and i should put my self out of my misery already.	distorted	1
i often cried out suddenly and fight to my bf by telling about them but he never fight me back.	distorted	1
whatever it is, these problems with sharp objects, torure scenerios and enclosed places must stop but i don't know how.	distorted	1
i question reality and get confused about the concept of time and sometimes i completely forget who i am.	distorted	1
i have no friends because i am embarrassed of myself and my decisions and dont want to expose myself as a fraud to anyone.	distorted	1
is this some kind of possible mental disorder? should i see someone? also in the last few days i have had trouble sleeping 4 hours tops some nights.	distorted	1
my bf mentioned to me that is bothers him that he has never been to my house and my living situation bothers him but says he will not make an excuse for what he has done he says he made a mistake and its not going to happen again.	distorted	1
i remember my dad raped me in the kitchen and i blacked out because i couldn't breathe.	distorted	1
he asks me why i cant just accept that it is what turns him on but it hurts because i should be enough.	distorted	1
i'm feeling hurt and abandoned and this reminds me that i can't trust anyone ever again.	distorted	1
i don't know what to do since i have no medical insurance, no money, and medications have never made a difference in the past.	distorted	1
but that now first kicked off the huge fear of a major depression that could change my attitude one day towards the fact that i don't want to die.	distorted	1
he also just refused to see the severity of anything that happened in my life–when i was admitted to the hospital with unexplained chest pain, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms, he remained convinced that it was low blood sugar because i don't eat healthily (it turned out to be an acute stress reaction).	distorted	1
please help me to overcome my meaningless fear and the big one of the big problems for me is i'm not very happy with my physique… i'm a very skinny guy and of course, i just want to get rid of this skinny shit… pls help me what should i do…….	distorted	1
i did not tell my best friends immediately about the betrayal because i cared more about my ex.	distorted	1
i often plot to kill myself, but never go through with it due to family being home.	distorted	1
but, when they aren't mad; everything is fine.	distorted	1
the thing is that every time i start fasting i can't complete the goal that i set and it makes me hate myself even more.	distorted	1
i have never cut or tried to harm myself in any way.	non-distorted	0
"he gets furious, & says, ""i don't care if they screw up, & it's got nothing to do with you, so drop it!"" so after this problem description, i want to know what i can do? i have a couple alcoholics in my family as well."	distorted	1
the depression has been awful for the past 2 years, a way that in never was before.	distorted	1
from iran: i am very frustrated right now because my 57-year-old mom is very depressed, which by the way is not a new topic, yet it bothers me so much.	distorted	1
and never in my life had anything made more sense than this fear, it fits my past and current actions and thoughts exactly… and i know for a fact that this is one of the things i may be suffering from, if not the only thing.	distorted	1
i'm having trouble coaping with this that i always come running back to him because i miss him, but then again we fight again.	distorted	1
she's always on the phone to other people, got a massive extended family and it's too the point where i'm just ignored and neglected, despite me making time for her.	distorted	1
i'm always worried about having a heart attack.	distorted	1
i come here seeking advice on whether i should see a psychologist or not and, most importantly, why should i bother doing that.	distorted	1
a day never goes by where i don't think something is wrong with me.	distorted	1
i am scared of going out and see this people, because if i see them i always have crisis and there was one time i thought i would lose my control.	distorted	1
what makes it worse is i work with him and we act like nothing happened it is eating me up inside and i'm confused.	distorted	1
people around me tries very hard to help, but i feel it is useless.	distorted	1
"however, she makes me anxious as well, up to the point where i fear getting hurt or running into problems, not because i'm trying to take care of myself, but because i'm afraid she will say ""i told you so""."	distorted	1
i'm tired of wanting her back every day.	distorted	1
from that day, i can't stop thinking about all my family dying in a horrible way.	distorted	1
i also have a social worker , who has tried to help my mum in every was but she isn't accepting anything and now i have been told i just need to prepare myself for her killing herself.	distorted	1
i guess i'm mainly saddened that he was only 17 and he had a family that he left behind.	distorted	1
because of my anger issues, when my wife asks me a question or makes a statement to me, she feels that when i respond to her, i have a an attitude, or i am edgy in my responses.	distorted	1
it's become a problem for us because he's expressed that he feels he will never be able to do enough for me.	distorted	1
in the process of getting help i was diagnosed with adhd which made sense looking back at my behavior towards school, but i know that has nothing to do with my relationship fear.	distorted	1
i think that there are people who have it worse than i do, and that i should just stop thinking about it.	distorted	1
but i don't know how to tell my parents to just leave it alone, let us grow apart, we have nothing in common and just shouldn't be talking.	distorted	1
i have never dated a man who didn't lie or cheat or do something else bad to me.	distorted	1
my family is dysfunctional and after visiting my family this summer i have felt depressed and not motivated to do more than i have to.	distorted	1
i also get very anxious when i know he's coming home soon, because i know it is going to be constant critiques.	distorted	1
over the years i started to detach myself for him because i felt unhappy.	distorted	1
despite being in a few relationships, i have never had romantic feelings for anyone.	distorted	1
i always thought that that was just a phase and it would go away with time but everything got worse when i entered middle school, i started having strong body image issues, i even got an eating disorder for two years.	distorted	1
i feel like it's mostly gone away, only slight depersonalization and derealization and anxiousness (which worsens when i feel anxiousness), and i'm terrified of marijuana now.	distorted	1
if i try to tell her what worked for me, she immediately rejects anything i have to offer.	distorted	1
i don't understand what makes me such a bad person that i am that unlikeable.	distorted	1
broke up with my bf only because of long distance and can't think of marriage as we are still young in our careers 3.	distorted	1
my father is a lazy alcoholic and he was emotionally absent, my mother loved me a lot but her sharp criticism destroyed my self esteem and the fact that she didn't care about me very deeply, but only on the surface.	distorted	1
i don't know what's wrong with me, from the age or 12 i have been unhappy, i was bullied as a child and have had weight issues all my life.	distorted	1
not to mention my weight changes, i'd go from binge eating to nearly starving myself because i just wasn't hungry any more.	distorted	1
do you think a therapist will help me through the anxiety and depression without making me address the eating issues?  i am not experiencing any ill health effects and just want to lose 7 more pounds.	distorted	1
everyone keeps telling me i'm stupid to stay i just don't know what is keeping me there.	distorted	1
and we had sex, he only wore a condom part of the time which terrified me but i was in too much shock to say anything.	distorted	1
i feel like at times things can be good but right when i think that, arguing or something happens.	distorted	1
nothing has happened so far but i am afraid that someday i might no longer be able to control it anymore.	distorted	1
over the last week i have this screaming thought in my head that i am gay, and i can't seem to get rid of it no matter how hard i try.	distorted	1
if i get injured or sick i try to deal with it myself so my mother and brother don't have to deal with me.	distorted	1
but my parents refuse to let me go back home to my daughter's father and we want to get back together i need some advice on how to go about everything.	distorted	1
he said he wanted to see us at fathers day and never showed up and i was very upset.	distorted	1
i consider him my conscience but he says he is a very powerfull being who has gotten tied with the wrong person.	distorted	1
i'm always fighting with my parents, especially my dad; he yells at me a lot.	distorted	1
it has gotten to the point where people take a quick glance at me whenever they see me because they think i am going to take an offensive look at them.	distorted	1
saying that i'm pathetic out loud only makes me more pathetic.	distorted	1
"getting back home she pouts and ignored me until my father comes home and she starts complaining about how i am ""so disrespectful"" and ""should be punished."	distorted	1
i hardly ever feel sad or stressed.	distorted	1
once the car was completely underwater, i began to have trouble breathing and immediately woke up, gasping for air.	distorted	1
however, it seemed no matter how i responded, he would find fault with it, and i felt like i was walking on eggshells when he was around because i never knew what would irritate him next.	distorted	1
sometimes i plan out how i would kill myself even though i know i would never do it.	distorted	1
my husband feels it won't do any good for him to come here but will only stress us out (me in particular).	distorted	1
my daughter was only nine when she died.	distorted	1
i was also not eating, i was always feeling down and sad, and i couldn't sleep at night.	distorted	1
since new years day (4 days ago) i have been experiencing bad insomnia, severe panic attacks and dissociation like never before.	distorted	1
i have never talked to any of my close friends about these things because they come to me with their problems looking for advice, and i don't want to burden them with my problems.	distorted	1
well a couple months ago i began to feel the same way again due to stress from finances, relationship problems and such and i want know what i should do.	distorted	1
i don't know if i'm right about being paranoid and should do something about my mom, or i'm sick.	distorted	1
so to start off my mom and i didn't always have a terrible relationship.	distorted	1
i don't feel angry, i'm not at all a serious person, i just laugh at horror movies or when im in pain.	non-distorted	0
no matter what i'm doing, or which role i'm fulfilling, i feel like a fake.	distorted	1
i am in college now, and the abuse has slowed down because i'm better at avoiding it.	non-distorted	0
i have to check around my room before i lie down, before and after turning off the lights! i can't be in the house alone even in the day time because i feel like being murdered is inevitable.	distorted	1
i know that i must have depression, because no matter what i do those feelings of helplessness towards myself keep coming back.	distorted	1
i'm still doubtful though because i am a sadomasochist, i like to get hurt as well as hurt people.	distorted	1
i have never had it diagnosed, i am too ashamed and fearful of being 'branded'.	distorted	1
i also am becoming angry far quicker than i ever have.	distorted	1
we have a lot of problems because i feel he's not affectionate enough towards me and i'm always seeking validation.	distorted	1
psychos think they are better than everyone else, maybe that's what i think, and maybe i am in early stages of becoming a serial killer / killer.	distorted	1
and it puts me into a helpless panic attack.	distorted	1
i don't know how to talk to him without us both feeling like horrible people and i don't know how to get over what happened when i feel like it's invalid for me to be upset at all about what happened, since it wasn't as bad as what many people experience.	distorted	1

a lot of the time i hear it when i'm alone and no one is there, which scares me.	distorted	1

she has only been to a doctor to prove her diagnoses right and to get anti- depressants and sleeping pills.	distorted	1
yelling makes me uncomfortable, and it never seems to solve anything, so i only do it when if feels like the only way to get attention–and then i feel horribly afterwards.	distorted	1

my mom always tells me i am ungrateful and don't deserve anything.	distorted	1
i decided that i was being rude to everyone, mostly him so i decided we should leave.	distorted	1
anyway, on the night in question, i unknowingly triggered a flashback to trauma which occurred years before we met that she had never told me about.	distorted	1
i think scary thoughts sometime, it's been happening since i was a kid and ever since i had my daughter it's been worse.	distorted	1
however, my homesickness has nothing to do with missing my family and friends (not particularly), i just miss not being in university, it's incredibly stressful; i have a part-time job which causes me extreme anxiety.	distorted	1
my parents think i am a bad parent for wanting him to be there knowing what he did.	distorted	1
i want to make sure that he knows i sympathize with his insecurities but at the same time i cannot handle it when he attacks the fact i was with others before him.	non-distorted	0

i feel like he is a spoiled brat sometimes because he gets so mad when he doesn't get his way.	distorted	1
typing this out in struggling because i can't even function.	distorted	1
how could he know how it should be handled? was he pregnant? did he have to kill his child? it broke my heart and all he had to say about it was that i didn't handle it properly.	distorted	1
i can only sleep after i stay up so late that i exhaust myself completely and that's when some of my brain slows down.	distorted	1

i try my best to avoid conflict, but go as far as inconveniencing myself to avoid inconveniencing others.	distorted	1
i completely panic.	distorted	1
i keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way, because like i said, i don't seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people.	distorted	1
i have intense intrusive thoughts that keep me up every night (i haven't slept yet, it's 8am on the dot and i'm really unable to sleep) and sometimes the thoughts go as far that i think about harming myself or worse.	distorted	1
i'd like to go back to my therapist but feel like he'd think it was dumb (because i feel like it's dumb.	distorted	1
i think it's because i have seen to many scary movies and documentaries of serial killers.	distorted	1
i know that i don't eat as much as my family, but they are all overweight.	non-distorted	0
i thought about school shootings only wondering where i would get the gun.	distorted	1

i am unable to start a new relationship with another man because i am too needy and dependent.	distorted	1
hi, i'm pretty sure that my brother has always suffered from depression.	distorted	1
i'm scared to talk to my mom about it because i don't want her to think that i'm being dramatic.	distorted	1
i feel so guilty because i don't want my friends and family to feel upset or burdened by my problems and i really don't know what to do.	distorted	1
she is nothing like the person she used to be, and it's devastating.	distorted	1
but maybe that's the problem, i live for others and not myself? i just don't know what i should do or what i want to do about anything–school, career, relationships with others–my life.	distorted	1
the fact that i only feel aroused this way ever since i was a kid makes me mad, especially because it's not even associated with sex.	distorted	1
i've done everything from committing petty theft to hauling illegal substances in search of this feeling.	distorted	1
he still loves me and he knows we will be happy together, but he chose to give up on us … on our future together i feel devastated … hurt … empty and numb.	distorted	1

i was in a bad car crash months ago, my mother came straight up to the hospital while my father just turned over in bed and slept.	distorted	1
this is nothing serious, but i thought i am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better.	distorted	1
after that happened, my mom decided i should still live in the same house despite him laughing while apologizing to me (since he did tried to stop my breathing).	distorted	1
i broke up with my boyfriend about 3 months ago (about a month after school started), and ever since then, i feel very awkward when talking to anyone besides the people i have known for two years.	distorted	1
we left with my mom more than once but we always came back even when i thought 'there is no way she'd go back after what he did this time'.	distorted	1

we would talk out the few things we disagreed on but we never had any major issues that we disagreed or fought over.	distorted	1
but i don't think that's the case, my psychosis isn't only when i'm manic or depressed, it's even when i'm stable.	distorted	1

i'm unsure if i'm suffering from something that is undiagnosed or if i am just living the ordinary life and the other people around me are having the issues, it's all so confusing.	distorted	1
she told me my problems weren't that bad and when i told her i wanted to kill myself and that no one would care she said, why don't you try it and find out.	distorted	1

apart from that there are a bunch of thoughts that i don't know how to control, no matter if i tell myself that i'm being irrational, i always end up thinking that i have a serious desease, that i may have cancer.	distorted	1
i always thought he was just tired from work or just feeling grumpy because he has an unstable mom.	distorted	1

"i think about my ""friend"" or my whole family dying a lot and it doesn't bother me at all."	distorted	1
now the real problem is that since he doesn't have a college degree and comes from a broken up family (different family upbringing) my mom is telling me to break it off with him.	distorted	1

i used to be a 'happy' person with the occasional 'sad' moments, now i am a sad person with some rare 'happy' moments.	distorted	1
the reason i'm asking about this is because i'm often in a violent mood.	distorted	1

he can only be stimulated if i say things to anger him and he talks to me like i am dirt and a whore.	distorted	1
i feel unaccepted, worthless, and often a burden on others, even when by myself.	distorted	1
he was only there when i was having trouble at school with bullies or fears that it would happen again, but i am on summer break right now and he is back.	non-distorted	0
anyway i get anxious with my boyfriend sometimes and i think it's because of what happened, but every time i think about telling her i feel sick and panicky like i can't breathe.	distorted	1
it's been 3 years since i talked with a counselor or a teacher and now when i am in need of talking with someone about my problems i find it very hard to do so without reading into their facial expressions and getting really nervous about what they think of me.	distorted	1
i'm a 23 year old woman who has recently been thrown into a huge amount of responsibility due to the death of my father-and roughly a week later, the death of my mother.	distorted	1
this year i have suffered through periods of self harm and deep depression, because i feel like i am losing control and i don't know how to break the pattern, i do not allow anyone to get close to me and i make it so i have no one to turn to.	distorted	1
even my own father end up in hospital in critical condition and deep down i felt nothing.	distorted	1
i am running out of options and nothing and no one is making me feel any better, and i hate myself for saying that because i know i am the only one able to fix my life, but then again, i feel so alone and need someone, something, anything.	distorted	1
i sometimes cry myself to sleep because i can't be with her full time.	distorted	1
i would like to mention that i can't call for a therapist, simply because my parents will find out and i can't risk being disclosed and thought as a freak by my family or anyone close to me.	distorted	1
i have begun worrying that i am going crazy, or that i'm skitzofrenic or psychotic even though i have never seen or heard anything that wasn't there.	distorted	1
i'm constantly worrying about everything even if i have no control over it and tonight, i cut myself.	distorted	1
i have always fantasized about hurting and killing animals and people, but there is a part of me that knows that it isn't the right thing to do.	distorted	1
she's completely irrational and i'm worried that she might have some underlying mental problems.	distorted	1
it causes me a lot of issues in my job and my professional performance because i lack self-confidence and fear being judged.	distorted	1
i don't do anything to aggravate him, in fact i try to avoid him seeing me (since just seeing me aggravates him) but he would find me and abuse me for any or no reason at all.	distorted	1
i'm scared to talk about this with my therapist because i'm scared of what she might tell me.	distorted	1
i think she's going to be understanding and sympathetic like she always is but what if she isn't? i can't stop worrying about it.	distorted	1
she made sure he would never come back to our club or contact me again, which helped a lot, but i cant stop thinking about how stupid i was for letting myself do those things.	distorted	1
he spent money he shouldn't have nothing i did was good enough for him (not even support).	distorted	1
she lied to her shrink about the rape, the family even her friends in front of my about this rape which never occurred.	distorted	1
i have thought about trying to become a serial killer all of it but the 1% of my mind is holding me back.	distorted	1
i cannot seem to get out of bed, the very thought of facing the world every day makes me cry and debate my life.	distorted	1
she used to abuse us and still saying we're not important and never let us express ourselves and always nagging on me and my brother and so on my dad.	distorted	1
she had a major panic attack and was hospitalized for 2 weeks, which was very traumatic.	distorted	1
i need help, i need to know what should i do if i want to rape and murder people.	distorted	1
when i think about what's wrong with me i can't think at all.	distorted	1
though recently i've been hating social interaction and have felt completely numb in general.	distorted	1
after we broke up i met someone else, whom i love a lot but because i still dwelled on my old relationship we broke up too.	distorted	1
i chose to hide my struggle so never got tested for mood disorders.	distorted	1
also she has one labeled food journal but i didn't get to look at it because i didn't want to arouse suspicion for taking too long.	distorted	1
it got me panicking and later on i think that my feelings were exaggerated due to anxiety and there was nothing sexual there.	distorted	1
this didn't cause me to hate her at all as she did apologize and we eventually became closer.	distorted	1
it feels like no matter what i do to get better, i can't get away from people telling me they cut or are suicidal.	distorted	1
i'm always depressed when i'm not around my ex.	distorted	1
it's gotten to the point that deciding which course for college i should choose or turn down is pushing me into panic.	distorted	1
"if i ever formed an attachment to a woman and the feeling was mutual, i instantly pushed her away, as if saying ""what's wrong with you?? how can you be with me???"" i always knew i'd make a bad husband, not because i was cruel, but because i can't be close."	distorted	1
since i would hate to see my parents hurt, especially because of me, it is a constant thought in my mind that if my parents were dead i would do this and that.	distorted	1
i never know what to say to people at dinners or anything so i have panic attacks.	distorted	1
i have never had a friend or even have spoken to someone my own age.	distorted	1
now the problem is, i want the infatuation to stop but i don't want to cut her or her band out of my life completely.	distorted	1
the bad thing is that i cannot express love or open myself to any bpdy because i just can't feel what they feel… i imagine it as some kind of a barrier in me.	distorted	1
i wouldn't talk to anyone for the rest of the night after that because i would break into tears and stress thinking about how he died.	distorted	1
he's been a little different ever since we were younger and he was bullied extensively in high school.	distorted	1
i worry about every little thing and i feel so depressed because of things that haven't even happened.	distorted	1
i don't want to be a bad mother and i don't want to lose my family.	distorted	1
i'm always arguing with my mom and my two brothers everyday.	distorted	1
i know what people think of me, i'm a bad person.	distorted	1
i only drank from the age of 20-23, but i drank so heavily i went into acute liver failure on may 31, 2013.	non-distorted	0
doing a lot of this on my own with only family support and little support from the father but stuck with past feelings for him even though he's cheated.	distorted	1
he doesn't know what to do when i cry and never talks about his feelings.	distorted	1
we have no idea when i should meet his son (my own therapist suggested 6 -12 months after the split to give the child time to grieve it has been 8 months since my boyfriend and his ex split).	distorted	1
i'm so lonely and have nothing to look forward to.	distorted	1
my grandma (who i live with) gets me in trouble because i'm supposed to be older than that and not react.	distorted	1
and often i feel depressed because of all these various thoughts that keep running in my mind.	distorted	1
for a while now i've had this problem where if something doesn't feel exactly right i have to fix it until it does feel right and it's hard to focus on anything else if i leave it.	distorted	1
"my younger self always thought i would be ""me"", uninfluenced by external forces, but it appears that i'm losing the ""me"" i used to be, and not for the better."	distorted	1
i'm 21 and i was raped almost two years ago and every since i have had this obsession with rape.	distorted	1
even from when i was young, she was always very violent when she was angry and she would break a lot of furniture but i thought that this was a normal adult behavior.	distorted	1
he really didn't, there were no bruisings and i know it was because i was going to do something much worst.	distorted	1
the thoughts eventually stopped and i went to the doctor and she diagnosed me with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and prescribed zoloft in which i didn't take due to my boyfriend saying that it will not help me but have me in this dazed out state of mind.	distorted	1
this is very embarrassing and i can't even talk to my therapist about this face to face because i feel weird about it.	distorted	1
she love of my life but i feel i should make her leave me so i don't ruin her life.	distorted	1
he is an acholoic and addictied to pain pills so he is that much worse in the evenings.	distorted	1
i cannot prove it was my mom, but no one else was in the house.	distorted	1
"usually i recite the numbers ""1 2 9 10 5 9"" if i realise that i'm talking to myself in public because i start to panic and think people are going to think i'm strange even when no one has noticed."	distorted	1
i have worked a little but struggled in that environment because i cannot concentrate because i feel others are saying or thinking bad things about me.	distorted	1
i am never as good as anyone else.	distorted	1
i pray something horrible will happen to me just so i don't have to continue another day of agony.	distorted	1
i get extremely anxious every time i must attend workshops or conferences for this reason.	distorted	1
if i win something, i feel nothing, same thing with losing, watching movies, jump scares, death, surprises, birthdays, or anything else a normal person would react to.	distorted	1
i think i should see a therapist but i'm scared of therapists and not sure what to do.	distorted	1
i overcame depression years ago, but even without it i'm pretty much an introverted person, who has never been emotionally stabile and i feel like my boyfriend is using this against me.	distorted	1
sometimes crying, sometimes wanting to scream, nothing i do gets my mind off of it.	distorted	1
i am a 18 year old male who is very confused about what i want to do with my life.	distorted	1
i did come from an abusive home but nobody had been listening when i only spoke of the yelling and neglect and the hitting.	distorted	1
only my family knows my aversion of being around people ,but even then they don't know the extent of how i feel of just the thought of being around people, the fear that rises in the pit of my stomach ,and the feeling of becoming trapped, and not being able to breath as if someone is chocking me.	distorted	1
i do not want to have an intercourse with her, only to abandon her few days after.	distorted	1
"i cried over my kids eating breakfast and i am starting to cry over this because i feel stupid for not knowing why i constantly feel 'not normal""."	distorted	1
i feel like i'm in a corner with no way out, every possible path i need to take to fix myself, i cant bring myself to walk down whether its my self esteem, depression or social anxiety stopping me.	distorted	1
i feel depressed mostly because i think of myself as a failure, or because i'm afraid of the future and failure.	distorted	1
i recently failed out of college, and ever since, i am not sure i am okay.	distorted	1
i know you're gonna look at this and make assumptions because i'm a 16 year old girl and i self harm.	distorted	1
i hate what i have become and am losing faith in ever getting better i do not know what to and cannot commit to any form of therapy as bulimia and self harm, despite their destructiveness are my only thing i have left to hold on to, i do not understand how to let them go but its killing me.	distorted	1
before i go to bed at night i always have the worst thoughts of me getting avenge on my enemies or someone who has made me mad and it makes me get the shakes and i grind my teeth because i get so angry.	distorted	1
"throughout fights i had to scream ""watch your attitude!"" constantly! and not only that, it came to the point where we wanted to record her attitude towards mom because she kept arguing that her attitude was ""normal""."	distorted	1
what should i do? my life is so messed up.	distorted	1
i can't think of anything to say to start a conversation, sometimes if i'm lucky ill get a conversation going but then random negative thoughts just come back into my head, i get flustered, and the conversation goes back to nothing and i am once again awkward.	distorted	1
my grades in school are down because i do not feel like doing my work or even attending class, and it's only for the fact that i don't want to interact with people because i'm worried of being judged.	distorted	1
my mom has bipolar disorder and depression, she will spend a couple months never leaving her room and watching tv.	distorted	1
growing up my sister has always resented me, she's bullied me throughout my life, even publicly shaming me on facebook and twitter regularly.	distorted	1
i did a lot of research and found that i might be suffering from ocd and i have been meeting with a ocd specialist and have told him all of my concerns and he has told me that i have ocd, anxiety, and depression.	distorted	1
i never told anyone how i was treated at home or what went on, because i was embarrassed.	distorted	1
whenever i tell my parents we should get him to talk to someone, my dad just says he is being a typical moody teenage boy.	distorted	1
i'm starting to think that there's something wrong with me and it's my fault that he's angry at me all the time.	distorted	1
i can't get anything done, i can't focus on important things, because that makes me think about myself, which leads to me feeling worthless and hateful of myself.	distorted	1
i have tried talking to my parents (i didn't tell them all these details) but they just brush it off or think i'm just worrying or a crazy young person and they wont help me see a doctor, so i'm turning here for help.	distorted	1
told me it was my fault i struggled so badly to pay attention to my teacher because she never stayed on one topic.	distorted	1
at first i thought it was ocd, because i was diagnosed at a very young age, but now i' not sure that's the overall issue.	non-distorted	0
i would always cry and feel worthless because i always felt left out and thought they were getting closer to each other and they were going to leave me behind.	distorted	1
"she does not seem to hear me when i try to explain what the doctors have told me, saying things like ""what to hell do they know?"" and claiming my mental health diagnoses are a ""fashion in medicine""."	distorted	1
i am plagued by near-constant intrusive thoughts of all three main types – violent, religious and sexual.	non-distorted	0
my real childhood was an absolute horror, and i don't understand what is happening to me.	distorted	1
i didn't feel guilty, but i felt bad because i am addicted.	distorted	1
now i feel worthless in life.	distorted	1
i feel that i should leave him before any children come into the picture to avoid hurting more people.	distorted	1
i'm fairly certain that if one of my closest friends died i wouldn't feel bad at all.	distorted	1
next day i was fine but i found out my co-worker has passed away due to heroin overdose.	distorted	1
no matter the situation, he gets completely overwhelmed, starts thinking about the worst possible outcome, and stresses himself out.	distorted	1
not because i'm afraid but just stood and couldn't say no .	distorted	1
i should also add that my mom kicked me out 3 different times in high school each after my stepdad abused me.	distorted	1
except i still fail at being likable to 90% of my class because i come off as awkward.	distorted	1
so i am an educated women, i don't want to made out as some poor little helpless house wife who doesn't have two nickels to rub together.	distorted	1
neither of us are friends with her now but we don't want to just ignore the fact that she has symptoms of mental illness.	distorted	1
it's gotten to the point where i won't finish books or series or won't draw or won't listen to certain songs because i just feel really sad and empty when i do.	distorted	1
i feel like i keep slipping in and out of crazy, i don't even have panic attacks anymore but i always have this overwhelming since of anxiety and derealization.	distorted	1
just a quick background, im 29 never met my father and lost my mother to cancer when i was 16.	distorted	1
i have to conceal my shopping list or the stuff i buy and whenever they find it ,they judge me and criticize me immediately.	distorted	1
but there is no way to prevent that from happening because i'm only 18 and am still covered under my mom's insurance.	distorted	1
i noticed my issue upon a death within the family, throughout the entire process i didn't feel anything, at points i even tried to force myself to feel as i thought i would be a horrible for not doing so.	distorted	1
i was the only one besides my mom who didn't cry.	distorted	1
i did a horrible, unforgivable, disgusting thing when i was 13/14 (i can't really bring myself to say it because it is so sickening).	distorted	1
i'm really sad all the time.	distorted	1
everyday i have to do these counting and moving rituals although some days are worse than others.	distorted	1
i am so bored and disillusioned with everything at this point in my life that i don't even feel like a real person.	distorted	1
"or maybe the anxiety and panic attacks were such a huge blow to my ""system"" that i am normal but i keep over thinking everything and doubting my ""realness""."	distorted	1
i have anger build up on me and i have nowhere to get it out on.	distorted	1
she wasn't a bad mom as i grew up.	distorted	1
i can inherit as disabled survivors pension only after their death.	non-distorted	0
i plan to move because of unrelated issues, but because of my mom, i am hesitating.	distorted	1
i just hate feeling like i'm a bad person.	distorted	1
hi, i am a 14 year old girl, and i think i may have a problem.	distorted	1
my relationship with my children's father has never been healthy (i realize that now).	distorted	1
i go to a psychiatric but when they ask me if i ever have the urge to use again or if i abused again i lie because my mom is in the room with.	distorted	1
however, he only makes an effort to make me orgasm about once a week or less, which seems unfair.	distorted	1
what if i dont accept me again? what if i have to go back home, a failure.	distorted	1
it's been two months, but i'm still crying myself to sleep every night.	distorted	1
i nearly crashed a car and killed myself unintentionaly because i got mad.	distorted	1
i also have a tendency to lose my train of thought always.	distorted	1
the reality is, i should have seen a counselor a very long time ago but i was always reluctant too until a recent breakdown.	distorted	1
i was in such a bad condition that when my mother applied for disability on my behalf i was accepted immediately.	distorted	1
if i have to call someone or see them in person, i will put it off for weeks or even months just to avoid being in a situation that i am uncomfortable with.	distorted	1
it got to a point at times i was choking back tears because i was so anxious.	distorted	1
however, i worry that i'm not being as loving towards her as i feel i should be.	distorted	1
i hate myself for never being able to scream.	distorted	1
i have never been caught doing anything, nor do i do anything remotely bad in any sense.	distorted	1
i only want to have sex with him and to make it worse, i get jealous when he even mentions other girls.	distorted	1
in school i never fit in with others (fighting, manipulation, terrorize) finding them to be mindless robots that have no real purpose too easily controlled, a feeling that hasn't gone away in adulthood.	distorted	1
she is an adult now and after my therapy i contacted her and admitted how wrong it was what i had done to her and took responsibility for my actions.	non-distorted	0
i have no one to talk to about my problems.	distorted	1
i already see a therapist because my mom thinks im have anger problems.	distorted	1
i feel like a loser, failure and disappointment.	distorted	1
i have thought of suicide before but i could never do that because of my kids that need me here.	distorted	1
it gets worse day by day and my parents don't ever listen to what i have to say,they threaten me to shut me up, i have tried multiple times talking to them but no avail.	distorted	1
firstly, i am a complete failure.	distorted	1
honestly, i started cutting myself because i was bored but it became very serious: now i have suicidal thoughts.	distorted	1
bottom line, i don't know how to handle all of this and it hurts.	distorted	1
should i just leave him? can he love at all? should i confront him? i have never openly asked him about his desires to kill because it scares me.	distorted	1
"in that session she told my partner that our communication would never be ""awesome"" she also told him that i would never be happy with him."	distorted	1
i always fought for us even when it's painful and hurtful.	distorted	1
i don't know if it's just from his moods or not, but i am scared that he is only saying this because he's afraid to hurt me again.	distorted	1
she makes out she feels bad and she's there for me but she never has been before so why now.	distorted	1
i hate going to school because it is just a constant reminder of how my life will never be the way i long for it to be.	distorted	1
"everyone i talk to claims ""men cheat"" and that what he did, while wrong and inexcusable, shouldn't be ground for break up."	distorted	1
he has been doing much better with not drinking but i have caught him lying about it because i can tell when he is.	distorted	1
i don't treat them with disrespect but i constantly feel as if they believe i am a bad daughter.	distorted	1
while my brother's criminal record has only grown, landing him in a fancy rehabilitation facility for 6 months to avoid jail.	distorted	1
it's something that i can't really get rid of no matter how hard i try.	distorted	1
i always feel like i'm going to have a panic attack.	distorted	1
he said its my fault i'm ugly because i eat too much.	distorted	1
i feel as if that confusion also stems from the  rapid fire of thoughts always in my head.	distorted	1
god has always been a center in my family's life, but never felt the faith thrust upon me.	non-distorted	0
one moment i am in a good/happy mood and then the next i am completely angered and in the worse moods ever.	distorted	1
later i found out, his mother had anger problems as well, when she would get mad at her son she would scream, throw wooden boxes at his head and give him a concussion, use any object to hurt him not caring what it was the only thing she didn't use were knives.	distorted	1
i feel very irritable when i do have to get up to do anything, and not being able to do anything has been with me since my depression started pretty much.	distorted	1
everyone at school thinks i'm a freak because of what happened last year.	distorted	1
i returned to work within a few months of each birth, despite being complicated and difficult birth of 2nd son and the sudden death of my mother when he was only a few months old.	distorted	1
i will be miserable if i cannot keep my friendship with him but my stomach stays in knots because i have now been excluded from my family.	distorted	1
"my parents consider me ""unsympathetic"" ""selfish and self centered"" and tell me that my actions are hurtful and disrespectful, but i don't always know why they should have been offended."	distorted	1
i have contemplated suicide, but not because i was depressed but because my life is routine and routine is boring and being bored is probably one of the worst feelings.	distorted	1
she has told me i don't have a right to be upset because at my age (24) i have nothing to be down about.	distorted	1
should i just let it go? seems unfortunate it has to be this way.	distorted	1
i am a 14 year old with asperger's disorder and i have an average normal family.	non-distorted	0
i've avoided treatment because i dislike medication due to past experiences and my last hospital visit didn't go well, so i'm afraid of the next one.	distorted	1
i'm 17years old and ever sinse 8th grade iv had an issue with cutting and scratching myself when i get angry and its mostly because my mom has yelled at me or gotten after me for something.	distorted	1
nothing ever eases the pain, i cry multiple times a day.	distorted	1
like i'm worthless, maybe broken or damaged beyond repair.	distorted	1
i am terrified of people talking to me or having to talk to people and it's a huge issue when it comes to my job.	distorted	1
so when i talked to my parents they said it was just because my hormones are all over the place, but would my hormones give me suicidal thoughts or wanting to cut.	distorted	1
i'm tired of having to face this every day and i knew i could not continue to avoid it, but the cruel remarks made me ashamed of myself.	distorted	1
i must have everything clean and in its spot at all times or i get super frustrated and lose my temper.	distorted	1
i don't have a best friend, but i want to kill my closest one.	distorted	1
my grandfather was a child molester, though i don't remember him ever molesting me.	distorted	1
my mom has the same thing but shes learned to live with it but no one else i know has it and i cant find any type of similar disorder.	distorted	1
i figured things would only get worse until the next week when my mood did a complete 180 and i suddenly knew the answers to life, the fact my ex wasn't talking to me no longer bothered me, i spent over $200 in 2 days (and the rest throughout the following week) etc.	distorted	1
i'd hate to grow up and be such a bad example to my kids.	distorted	1
he knows how much he has hurt me and seems genuinely sorry and ashamed but i am stuck and don't know what to do.	distorted	1
i don't know why, but i have never felt comfortable with people, and with the world around me.	distorted	1
something happened in november that made me feel worthless and horrible.	distorted	1
i am worried i will not be effective outside of a very narrow community.	distorted	1
she was banned from her family because of me being born out of wedlock.	distorted	1
my mother has had a terrible childhood.	distorted	1
i couldn't sleep at night i was in a complete panic that wouldn't end.	distorted	1
"he would just leave the ""tasty"" garbage there and then get mad every time because ""the dog shouldn't do that""."	distorted	1
the reason i'm here is because my t seems fidgety during every session.	distorted	1
i don't think be would cheat, but i also think there should be boundaries on closeness to prevent emotional cheating.	non-distorted	0
he started going on about how he was a bad person and i should see other people.	distorted	1
i sometimes wish this could be true, so i would have a reason to be such an angry person, but then i think that it must be terrible and i don't want to face this situations.	distorted	1
i don't like to use official words (depression, abuse, anxiety, disorder, etc) because i'm scared that i'm not worthy of them, i almost feel like they're titles that i don't deserve because i don't act the right way.	distorted	1
i'm feeling worthless and guilty.	distorted	1
i hate myself for ever wanting to hurt anyone.	distorted	1
i am depressed, lonely (seem to have nothing in common with those my age), sad and frankly a little desperate to be writing to an online forum.	distorted	1
this feeling of hatred or urge to hurt is only for specific infants (3 infants of my wife's sister, 2 infants of my wife's brother and 1 infant of an old female friend's brother).	distorted	1
i can't get over what i did, i feel depressed, and i feel like everything in my life is ruined because of this mistake.	distorted	1
i get very sad when this happens, because i would never say those things out loud, but it feels just as bad to think it.	distorted	1
is this something we should be concerned about? i worry the girls are being brought into their parents' marriage issues and in the process are being taught to interrogate their dad and worry about boundaries with him and friends.	distorted	1
when i'm walking home from school, i feel like every car that passes is going to kidnap me and murder or hurt me.	distorted	1
my mom knows i used to cut, but she thinks i stopped a year ago.	distorted	1
"when i was around 7 i used to break down crying because i felt guilty about doing something ""bad""."	distorted	1
when i was 13 i was in a bad accident where 30% of my body was burned with 3rd degree burns.	distorted	1
i never have dreams and i don't know why i can't sleep since it's been going on for this long there has got to be a real reason behind this.	distorted	1
but i feel like i am doomed to feel like this forever, having no respite unless i take high doses of medications.	distorted	1
i don't know what to do about this, my friends don't help, they hardly even listen, but every day i just feel closer to crying, and lately all of it's just making me want to die.	distorted	1
i also tried to cut myself three times in my wrist because i feel so worthless.	distorted	1
when i was younger the problems were so much worse, but ever since i became postpartum they are starting to bother me again.	distorted	1
i need to know if i should openly admit of being suicidal but can't do nothing about it because i can't do that to my only child.	distorted	1
can't we just live in peace? i have always considered running away, but i have never had enough courage to do so, under the fear that my mother will always end up finding me and scream at me and punish me.	distorted	1
the worst part is that that i had forgotten about my cousin then once when i was 17, the events flashedback but it was too late as i was now very attached to him as a brother.	distorted	1
i get the stiff feeling on the back of my head and have to divert me attention to my phone (which stops the shaking), i find it so hard to just walk normally on the street without pretending to be on my phone.	distorted	1
i am desperately seeking a job but no one will higher me because i have no work experience.	distorted	1
at one point we often laugh and talk together, when i want a hug she's the first person i'm going to, but at the same time she's the only person that i actually fell deep hatred towards.	distorted	1
i get angry over nothing.	distorted	1
i do care, i just don't know what to do or say in most situations, especially since he's always in physical pain and blames the stress that i'm causing him for that pain.	distorted	1

while i love him and genuinely want to grow old with him, i am fearful that this is not intelligent of me to do, nor practical to marry someone who is bipolar and seeking no treatment.	distorted	1
i have been thinking to do this for some time but never had the courage so here goes; for the past time i have been feeling so unloved and worthless.	distorted	1

i can't stop seeing myself as a horrible person and a weird sicko.	distorted	1
i was at a very very low point in my life after that breakup, i felt worthless and stupid.	distorted	1
it also makes me feel so aware of everything, even my awareness, i want to get outside of myself, but i can't hide from this hyper-awareness of my consciousness so it makes me even more freaked out (i feel trapped, condemned to listen to my inner voice for eternity).	distorted	1

i am writing cause i want to understand what is wrong with me and if i will ever have a normal life.	distorted	1
anyway i got over it but from long ago i always talk to myself it's something usual for me and i think it's normal but what made it stop being normal was when i started thinking that i have an other me inside of myself who wants to get me and hurt me and do all it can just to break me.	distorted	1
should i go to a doctors for depression ,anxiety? or should i not take it to serious? i feel lost.	distorted	1

i am so embarrassed because i frequently find myself fighting back tears in public.	distorted	1
i was always questioning my existence and i had suicidal thoughts.	distorted	1

a few years ago every day i contemplated life without me and thought about different ways of killing myself but i talked myself out of it.	distorted	1
and i think i must have been a bad child because i was hit a lot, but other than not participating in physical things, i don't remember being bad.	distorted	1
i thought i had depression and anxiety because i had many of the symptoms, but lately i've been doubting that (because of intrusive thoughts).	distorted	1
he insulted me,said things to me that one would not even say to their worst enemy.	distorted	1
i have sought to fill that void through relationships, but all have failed except the one i am currently in.	distorted	1
he gets mean and insults me and later he becomes upset because i'm upset about it and;i should know not to take anything seriously that he says when he's angry.	distorted	1
i was more depressed than i had ever been in my life.	distorted	1
i have too many problems and i don't know how to deal with all of them.	distorted	1
my ex is a very lonely woman and is willing to move to another country with this woman that she has only known a couple of weeks.	distorted	1
do you know what might have happened to me? is this some sort of screwed-up sexual thing? it doesn't feel like it, but i can't think of any other reason i would have urges to kill people of such a specific subset.	distorted	1
now i catch myself over eating when i'm stressed, i am always stressed.	distorted	1
it's very hard to explain it in writing, but it feels uncontrolable when i start to feel the anxiety and apprehension.	distorted	1
its getting to the point that my friend gets frustrated with me because i never want to hang out and just want to be alone.	distorted	1
