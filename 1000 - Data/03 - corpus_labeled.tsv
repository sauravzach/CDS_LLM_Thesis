people are only nice to me because they want something from me.	distorted	1
people tend to judge me harshly if they find out that i'm unemployed and single, which leads to nasty comments and gossip online.	distorted	1
people will think i'm incompetent. if i don't start getting better sleep i might even lose my job.	distorted	1
perhaps i'm the problem, as i'm too weird. i should stop trying to make new friends, as there is nobody else like me.	distorted	1
she always chooses where to go. she wears the pants in our relationship.	distorted	1
she did that deliberately. she is full of herself.	distorted	1
she doesn't care about me.	distorted	1
she doesn't see my recovery program as important.	distorted	1
she doesn't seem to appreciate how hard i work.	distorted	1
she doesn't understand how hard it is not to drink.	distorted	1
she doesn't seem very friendly towards me. what's wrong with me that she doesn't like me?	distorted	1
she has no respect for me. she probably thinks i'm not man enough.	distorted	1
she is a horrible person. i hate her.	distorted	1
she is being so unfair.	distorted	1
she is cheating on me. she is going to leave me.	distorted	1
she knows how bad i feel for not coming to the party, and she wants me to feel even worse.	distorted	1
she probably invited me because she felt obligated.	distorted	1
she probably never loved me as i did, and she must have forgotten our relationship already.	distorted	1
she sounded like she was mad at me. i don't know why she has to be so rude.	distorted	1
she thinks i'm not following her advice and is angry with me for not getting rid of this infection.	distorted	1
she will think i am a horrible person for not returning her call.	distorted	1
she'll be unhappy with my sales.	distorted	1
she's always giving me negative looks, like she did tonight.	distorted	1
she's looking for problems and will criticize me.	distorted	1
she's probably talking behind my back like happened at my last job.	distorted	1
since my son came home slightly drunk the other night, i'm sure he's on his way to becoming an alcoholic like his uncle; it will ruin his life.	distorted	1
something is wrong with me.	distorted	1
something terrible is going to happen.	distorted	1
sometimes i feel like i'm living in my own world and can't connect with others.	distorted	1
sure, they apologized, but it doesn't change the fact that they hurt me in the first place.	distorted	1
sure, they apologized, but it doesn't erase the hurt they caused.	distorted	1
sure, they did something nice for me, but that doesn't mean they're a good person.	distorted	1
sure, they did something right, but it doesn't mean they're not still a bad person.	distorted	1
sure, they made me laugh, but it doesn't change the fact that they can be annoying sometimes.	distorted	1
sure, they said something nice, but they probably don't really mean it.	distorted	1
sure, they were nice to me, but they're probably just trying to get something from me.	distorted	1
sure, they were supportive, but it doesn't erase all the times they let me down.	distorted	1
that guy is an animal; he should be punished; it's unfair.	distorted	1
that i am not a very likable person.	distorted	1
that's easy, but i don't think it would work for me.	distorted	1
that's right, it's not just that they won't talk to me, it's that no one will want to talk to me.	distorted	1
that's right, that no one will want to be my friend, and i will be there all alone.	distorted	1
that's totally impossible for me to do. i would just be too anxious.	distorted	1
the fact that i've never been able to form a close relationship is proof that i'm just not cut out for it.	distorted	1
the kids and grandkids don't need me any more.	distorted	1
the main problem is that i stand alone, while all the other teachers stand with a friend and talk to each other.	distorted	1
the mistakes you make define you as a person, there's no escaping it.	distorted	1
the past always catches up with you, and there's no escaping it.	distorted	1

the time.	distorted	1
the world is harsh and punishing.	distorted	1
the world is made up of winners and losers, and i sure don't want to be one of those losers.	distorted	1
the world is such a dark and scary place. it's hard to be optimistic about the future.	distorted	1
the world works against me.	distorted	1
there's no use in trying any more.	distorted	1
there's no point in even attempting to form a close relationship because i'm just going to get hurt in the end.	distorted	1
there's no point in pursuing my dreams because i'll never achieve them.	distorted	1
there's no point in trying to form close relationships because i'll never be able to overcome my unlikable nature.	distorted	1
there's something fundamentally wrong with me that makes people not want to be close to me.	distorted	1
these emotions are so painful that i have to kill myself, because i can't stand them any more.	distorted	1
they all would have had a better time if i hadn't been there today.	distorted	1
they apologized, but it doesn't mean they're not still a terrible partner.	distorted	1
they are able to do the work more easily than i am.	distorted	1
they are my family. i should love and respect them. i should go to keep the peace.	distorted	1
they did something good, but it doesn't mean they're not still a bad person.	distorted	1
they did something nice for me, but it doesn't mean they're not still a bad friend.	distorted	1
they did something nice, but it was probably just a fluke.	distorted	1
they did something right, but it doesn't mean they're not still a bad influence.	distorted	1
they didn't pay any attention to me all day.	distorted	1
they have accomplished great things, got into great schools, gotten awards, etc. but as for me, i feel like life has sucked.	distorted	1
they made a terrible mistake when they chose my book! i won't be able to do a good job.	distorted	1
they may have apologized, but it doesn't erase the hurt they caused in the first place.	distorted	1
they may have been sincere, but it doesn't change the fact that they're usually pretty fake.	distorted	1
they may have done something good, but it doesn't change the fact that they're usually pretty selfish.	distorted	1
they may have done something helpful, but it doesn't mean they're not still lazy.	distorted	1
they may have done something thoughtful, but it doesn't mean they're not still a selfish person.	distorted	1
they may have made a positive difference, but it doesn't mean they're not still a liar.	distorted	1
they may have made a positive impact, but it doesn't mean they're not still a hypocrite.	distorted	1
they might have had good intentions, but it doesn't change the fact that they screwed up.	distorted	1
they might have had good intentions, but it doesn't change the fact that they usually don't follow through.	distorted	1
they might have helped out, but it doesn't change the fact that they're usually pretty selfish.	distorted	1
they might have made me feel better, but it doesn't change the fact that they're usually pretty negative.	distorted	1
they might have made me laugh, but it doesn't mean they're not still annoying.	distorted	1
they might have shown support, but it doesn't change the fact that they're usually pretty unsympathetic.	distorted	1
they might have tried to help, but it doesn't change the fact that they usually just make things worse.	distorted	1
they probably aren't very interesting people. why torture myself?	distorted	1
they said something nice, but it doesn't change the fact that they usually talk behind my back.	distorted	1
they said they were proud of me, but they're probably just trying to make me feel better.	distorted	1
they should do the same thing unless they really don't care about me.	distorted	1
they should have hired me; what idiots!	distorted	1
they should show me respect because i have more talent than all of them put together.	distorted	1
they were kind to me, but it doesn't change the fact that they're usually pretty mean.	distorted	1
they will find out i'm a fraud and i can't do my job.	distorted	1
they would say it was ridiculous. that of course people would want to be my friend.	distorted	1
they're just a bunch of losers. i can tell because i feel so bored. .	distorted	1
they'll either think i'm faking it to take time off work or they'll think i am pathetic because i am anxious and depressed.	distorted	1
this feeling of fear is awful. i can't take it anymore.	distorted	1
this is a waste of time. many younger and better qualified people will apply to all these jobs.	distorted	1
this is too complicated for me to learn.	distorted	1
this is too difficult, i'm never going to figure it out.	distorted	1
this isn't going to work out.	distorted	1
this job is too challenging, i'm not cut out for it.	distorted	1
this party will be a drag.	distorted	1

is this simply my adhd causing memory problems and getting bored, or should i be looking into something else? (i should also mention that i suspect that i have borderline personality disorder due to emotional neglect/abuse from my parents and suddenly 4 years ago all my friends (known them for 7+ years) abandoned me.	distorted	1
nothing matters to me, genocides, war, politics in general seem to be unimportant.	distorted	1

he tells me i'm worthless and a stupid disapointment to him and the rest of my family.	distorted	1
i am always walking on eggshells around him, its seems like everything i do and do't do make him so angry.	distorted	1
a strong feeling of laziness has taken over me and whenever someone tells me i should do these things i become defensive and genuinely irritated and sometimes angry.	distorted	1
i thought i was moving on only to realize i was just being used to forget the 'mean ex' or make the 'mean ex' jealous.	distorted	1
if i just let my head face downwards i feel like i am doing harm to my body and depriving myself of a universal right.	distorted	1
i also sometimes doubt that maybe i did not exposed my problem to therapist on appropriate way, or that my therapist do not want to tell me my accurate diagnosis because i could be frightened of the fact i'm having/developing psychosis.	distorted	1
i can't imagine having feelings for him and i feel guilty because i think he is looking for something i cannot give him and he is really nice and i don't want to hurt his feelings.	distorted	1
it has got to the point where i have the first semester final exams next week and i have no idea what i am going to do, i can't seem to get into revision because i feel so panicked, which is just adding to the situation.	distorted	1

we got into an argument and i told her we were going to have to move i can't stand living with him.	distorted	1
i have little to no emotion and can't quite understand, nor do i care, about the emotions of others.	distorted	1
i want to give her an ultimatum to either take a medication later in the day to control her crying and raging or she has to leave but i am at a loss in how to word it.	distorted	1
i don't know how to start this at all but basically i constantly contradict myself or cannot make up my mind.	distorted	1
i can't go back to my therapist because i am bad at explaining how i feel, and i don't have the energy to do so.	distorted	1
however, i started realizing that all this time in isolation forced me to constantly focus on negative thoughts and i saw a significant decrease in my cognitive ability; things i could previously do quickly in high school took a lot longer now.	distorted	1
he said the only reason no one else would look at me without clothes is because i'm ugly.	distorted	1

i often have disturbing thoughts that come from nowhere and i am alone most of the day.	distorted	1
i have also been getting angry over small issues that should have little effect on me….	distorted	1
i can't live my life if i can't stop worrying about her all the time.	distorted	1
even when i was younger i sometimes self injured and when she found out she said only crazy people did that and that i'm better than that(i don't self harm anymore) so i started listening to her and thinking that.	distorted	1
i have moved 300 miles away from my home town to live with my partner so only have 2 good friends, i work in a busy office but he gets very paranoid and insecure.	distorted	1
i'm in a constant state of extreme rage i can't leave my living space because i can't control the rage when i'm around people.	distorted	1
when she does i just think and have to stop myself from acting but i just know that i could kill her.	distorted	1
whenever i get angry and think about killing myself, i feel weak because i'm never able go through with it.	distorted	1
i don't see the point of living anymore: i'm here because i'm afraid suicide if the only thing that makes sense for me to do now, but am open to other opinions.	distorted	1
i sometimes cry about this because i don't know what to do.	distorted	1

i always felt i could get by doing bare minimum, but life is coming fast and i fear i'm destined for failure.	distorted	1
logically this makes sense and i am a man of science but i can't move on, i keep having these weird feelings of regret, guilt towards myself and then detachement towards my girlfriend given her past…my head is full with all these images that make no sense whatsoever.	distorted	1
she's always struggled with depression, and has dropped out of middle school, then high school, then university.	distorted	1
i constantly feel the need to have a mental illness because i get bored by normal things.	distorted	1
for example around 5th grade my thoughts would just be putting someone in a punching bag and punching them till all your anger is out.	distorted	1
it also made it so when i got even a little bit stressed out, i'd get a lot of muscle tension, which would only worsen the brain fog/cognitive decline/short term memory loss.	distorted	1
it's like i can't breathe sometimes when i'm not with him and it is a dreadfully terrifying feeling.	distorted	1
"lately my mother is driving me crazy telling me how stupid i am, that i should get a divorce, that he is ""enjoying me"", that the man of the house should be the provider- not me; etc."	distorted	1

"i don't know if they are the same ocd type thoughts that i had as a kid but these thoughts tell me that i am a narcissistic person, that i am misdiagnosed, i can""t really explain those thoughts but they are confusing me."	distorted	1

i am struggling with addiction in a major way.	distorted	1
i don't even find these fantasies arousing, i find them more annoying, but in the end all this train of thought leads me to is panic of being a pedophile and tiny stomach pains.	distorted	1
i would go outside and sit crouched facing the corner with a hood over my head just to smoke because i was so terrified.	distorted	1
why though? is it because i get ptsd over the littlest of things? i didn't have trauma in my childhood and nor did i have it at all.	distorted	1
some days in school i have to go into the bathroom and cry.	distorted	1
i feel i am completely incapable of making any correct decisions and i only make things worse.	distorted	1
i'm very stressed because i have a ton more homework now that i just started high school and i have mental breakdowns a lot more now.	distorted	1
i know it was horrible and traumatizing but i feel like i've come to terms with it, but i'm still terrified of my parents.	distorted	1
i kept it inside and only told one person, she was my closest friend that i could talk to, when i told her, i broke down crying and it was very upsetting.	distorted	1

i don't understand why everyone seems to think i'm so violent when the last physical fight i got in was at least 5 years ago.	distorted	1
what on earth should i do? is there any way i can wean myself off of these irrational precautions without making myself overly uncomfortable? thank you in advance.	distorted	1
but when i tried to convince myself i had no depression i started feeling like i wasn't myself each time sliding from happiness to pain of depression and something traumatic happened to me that made me think all the time that i'm just dreaming, i stayed this way for months.	distorted	1
i went to a regular doctor because i am not too old for a pediatrician and i am not sick, i do not have mono but i did end up crying for no reason during the appointment so i walked out of my physical with a clean bill of health but with an anxiety/panic coping packet.	distorted	1
i'm worthless, and i don't think i'll ever feel differently.	distorted	1
i see violent things, but would never act on them, i'm not violent at all.	non-distorted	0

i know you will probably think i'm some kind of sick weirdo after what i'm about to say, but i have to get it off my chest.	distorted	1
and now she's different, she has violent tendencies and she says she thinks people are talking about her or staring at her when no one is, she thought my mom and aunt were talking about her but we haven't seen her in over a month so she couldn't have known at all.	distorted	1
i am not seeing a therapist right now, mostly because i don't have any events to talk about, no traumatic memories, they all treat me like a waste of space.	distorted	1
i never told my husband about me being abused and only told my mother at the age of about 25.	distorted	1
so my question would be: whether i'm ill at all or not, and if i indeed have mental problems, what they might be and whether i should bother a therapist with my problems or not.	distorted	1
my rapists wanted to degrade and humiliate me and i lost my virginity while being told i was ugly and worthless.	distorted	1

i think bad sexual thoughts, but what bothers me the most is that i can't fall asleep because i make a popping sound with my lips over and over.	distorted	1
he knows my situation, about my anxiety and stress, that i'm using drugs.	distorted	1
my boyfriend of 4 yrs broke up with me and i don't know if i should just move on or try and make it work once again.	distorted	1
for example if i am at the grocery store and i see a cute guy i would imagine i was his girlfriend and we had the perfect relationship, but if a another girl went to him i would get so upset and i would have to leave the store because of that.	distorted	1
he never arrived home, but had a car accident on the way home.	distorted	1
i worry i won't ever be able to be naked or intimate with anyone again.	distorted	1
i have thought before after i had finished having one of these 'fits' that if i saw a video of someone else behaving in the same way i would think that they were completely insane.	distorted	1
hey, i'm only 23 years old and i feel like i'm having a mid-life crisis.	distorted	1
"she never said "" i love you"" even once when growing up."	distorted	1
constantly being reminded just makes me feel dumb and worthless and unlovable.	distorted	1
i've always felt the emptiness, the numbness, fatigue and often the suicidal ideation (more often than i care to elaborate on).	distorted	1
what could this be brought on by? i have been diagnosed with depression and have been taking anti-depressants for years but this has always remained with me for as long as i can remember.	distorted	1
i know there's nothing to be afraid of but still get the fears.	distorted	1
i am isolating myself because i am embarrassed of what i'm doing with my jaw and eyes.	distorted	1
just why do i have so many problems with maintaining a relationship because as soon as anything serious happens i drop everything without thought.	distorted	1
the feeling that she is hiding something from me by often being vague and a growing feeling that i should check here phone is making me utterly sad and i have a feeling that i am slowly blowing myself up and will annoy here so much or myself that my relationship will end.	distorted	1
he also accused me more than once of cheating when i never once cheated.	distorted	1
i have suffered depression in the past and am still struggling with it because of my parents.	distorted	1
i was about 2 months clean, but me and my mom recently got in a huge argument … i cut so bad.	distorted	1
i'm diagnosed with schizophrenia but i feel it is wrong.	distorted	1
i know there has to be something wrong with me.	distorted	1
my only memories of him were him leaving to work at 5am and coming back at 10pm to fight with my mom then sleep.	distorted	1
he has never picked up a shotgun again since when he had thoughts about murdering his family.	distorted	1
my parents and i must do anything he says, get out of the same room he is in, and not talk to him or he will go insane.	distorted	1
i thought i was going to hell no matter what.	distorted	1
my panic attacks only happen with people who i am unfamiliar with.	distorted	1
he never knew that i had cheated on him and i confessed to him just recently, about 5 months ago.	distorted	1
i thought for many years that i lack emotion and as i get older i have come to realize that this is true and has been present since childhood; pictures that i have taken i noticed that i never smiled.	distorted	1
after i couldn't kill him i just went inside my room and started slapping myself until my hands didn't work well… what am i? am i a psychopath?? or is it just those series playing tricks with my mind because i have cried 5 or 6 times that i recall of (i meant after i was a grown guy maybe 16-20).	distorted	1
i don't what's wrong with me… i was wondering if you could give me a suggestion on what i should do, or what is possibly wrong with me.	distorted	1
"however, i feel like any second now someone will ""find me out,"" and everyone will realize i am a fraud."	distorted	1
he has also stopped having sex with me for a long while and says things like 'i should not ask for it' as i am guilty for the poor state of our relationship.	distorted	1
"she fits everything that i thought i ""wanted"" but now i'm so confused."	distorted	1
i get so nostalgic for my world to be real that it makes me suicidal sometimes because i know the world will never be that way.	distorted	1
one who doesn't have all of these problems.	distorted	1
i feel like a loser if im home alone on the weekends.	distorted	1
people think i'm rude because i don't talk.	distorted	1
it tells me that i'm a loser, i'm lazy, and it asks me what am i doing, why do i bother to continue living.	distorted	1
he now admitted that he is seeing people that he knows have died.	distorted	1
i'm completely lost, i feel like i'm going to explode inside and the only release i get is from drugs and cutting myself, i abnormally skinny and learned to hate the world.	distorted	1
but i feel like it's not enough anymore, i want to kill i want to take control.	distorted	1
we tried multiple anti depressants and high dosage of kolonopin because i also suffer with extreme anxiety(scared to talk in public,skip school from fear of crowd of peers, profuse sweating when in public) the anti depressants didn't work and neither did the kpin.	distorted	1
i am a sophomore in high school, and since middle school i have had suicidal thoughts, and attempted about twice.	distorted	1
i don't know what else to do, it is affecting me more than i though, i always worry about him.	distorted	1
back then i thought being alone and having no love in my life or being ugly and awkward is the worst thing that can happen but the truth is right now things are even worse.	distorted	1
within a day, he is a raging lunatic.	distorted	1
i just want to stop the cycle of thinking about me being a pedophile and it ruining my life because i feel like it's making me more and more anxious.	distorted	1
i'm not one to whine about my problems because i know people have it worse then me but i can't push down my feelings anymore.	distorted	1
after that i hated looking at the mirror at myself because i thought/think that i'm ugly and the only time that i did look in the mirror was to scrutinize my flaws and point out exactly what made me not pretty.	distorted	1
i think i may hold some things against her that i cant let go, like maybe some of the words she has used when shes upset…or looking at her so depressed made me mad because i know she is better than that.	distorted	1
it made me very anti-social, and i realize now why people tended to avoid me, probably because i was giving off some bad vibes.	distorted	1
it's only gotten worse and lately it's gotten almost unbearable.	distorted	1
i'm always in pain unless i'm venting to my ex.	distorted	1
it's frustrating because i feel like such an idiot compared to my peers.	distorted	1
if something takes too long to fix, i will become frustrated and completely give up.	distorted	1
i think he doesn't care because he's always picking a fight with me and he's blaming every fight on me saying i started it like a child.	distorted	1
i really dislike talking to people, not for any particular reason either, i would just prefer to not have to talk.	distorted	1
i don't want to be on this earth somtimes i'm just ready to die an go because i find no purpose here.	distorted	1
my mother wants to know everything about my life but she gets mad when i tell her that i don't want to talk to her.	distorted	1
i'm having bad breakdowns again and i know it's mostly because of my boyfriend.	distorted	1
i feel so lonely and unloved that i often cry (i never realized how much a person can cry.	distorted	1
i don't blame him for nothing because he try to make me feel like nothing happened bad, but i feel the ignoring and i feel the pain and the way he act make me more sad because he changed , i know this from his words,, he started to act like im his friend not a girlfriend.	distorted	1
i prefer to spend my time alone in my apartment or with my boyfriend only and i don't understand why it's so hard for me to be around other people.	distorted	1
i am suffering with obsessive thoughts about how many other women there were during the course of our relationship, while he says none, i am skeptical and question anything he ever told me.	distorted	1
it is a very sad case because he was normal growing up.	distorted	1
i feel that i don't belong and it's only a matter of time before others find out, which scares me.	distorted	1
i can't hold a conversation with the real her because i keep thinking of all the things the fake version of her has said.	distorted	1
i can even think of moments where one of them would leave me in the dark while vaguely communicating with me leading me to get frustrated and anxious over what in gods name they'd be doing only for them to be completely fine by the end of it.	distorted	1
i'm missing work either because i'm too busy crying or i just don't want to deal with life.	distorted	1
my worst moments are on a daily basis.	distorted	1
i bring up problems in the relationship because i think i dont get enough from my boyfriend.	distorted	1
its the worst when my partner and i are fighting.	distorted	1
and lastly sometimes i think that i am a fake and everything i'm saying is just to get attention.	distorted	1
the thoughts make me really anxious because i never know when it's going to happen.	distorted	1
i've never gone to a therapist before because the idea of talking about my mental condition gives me anxiety to the point of panic attacks, but now i'm starting to think that might be the key to fixing my problems.	distorted	1
i am so sick of feeling this way and have tried to scream it out, cry it out, and do everything and i can't think of what the problem is or how to solve it.	distorted	1
i do not understand why people have to be so cruel, especially at my age.	distorted	1
i am a teen who loves my family, however i get very annoyed and angry in my mind at unintelligent, annoying, attention craving people.	distorted	1
i'm scared because i don't know what's happening.	distorted	1
i used to be spoiled and loved but now my mom says i am worthless.	distorted	1
but that's not the only violent act i wish upon myself, i fantasize about being tortured, i want to die as a murder victim, i want my murderer to cut open my body, i want to see my insides.	distorted	1
in a breakdown recently i tried to explain my symptoms to my mother, but was so worried about upsetting her that i only managed half-truths.	distorted	1
when i am not doing any of these things and when i am not working, i am completely alone.	distorted	1
sorry to waste your time with a problem that is completely my fault, but i have been free of self-injury for over 1000 days now, but it is still a fight sometimes.	distorted	1
i have been suffering from major depression and have been attempting suicide since i was very young (only went to the hospital once for injecting bleach).	distorted	1
is this normal? if not, why is it happening to me? my main guess is this feeling is caused by the stress and trauma of my childhood, but speaking with others, they seem to vividly remember their events in a completely different manner than myself.	distorted	1
i started standing up to him and yelling back which only made it worse.	distorted	1
instead when i look at people i get this horrible feeling that they're thinking the worst of me.	distorted	1
i stopped myself from masturbation and have never done it out of fear.	distorted	1
is this a symptom of depression as well? i don't want to kill myself never thought of it.	distorted	1
i have never felt more cherished and more connected to anyone and 90% of the time things are wonderful but i'm plagued with insecurities.	distorted	1
so she gets to continue thinking she has nothing to do with his problems because it's only me who he treats this way.	distorted	1
i try to put my opinion in sometimes, but i guess he thinks i am stupid.	distorted	1
"i am either always depressed, irritable or completely ""done"" with the world and feel as if no one could do anything to change my view or the world itself."	distorted	1
but the thing is that i have never told anyone about my mom before and am worried about her response.	distorted	1
my questions is that how should family members behave with a patient of paranoid personality disorder and how can we save our children from being a victim of the same disease.	non-distorted	0
"i end up lashing out at him for my own insecurities and feelings of us not being ""perfect."	distorted	1
right after my grandmother died i also started pulling out my hair (trichotillmania) so it made me very self-conscious to the point where i thought i was the ugliest person ever which only made it harder to talk to people.	distorted	1
almost all of my actions, thoughts, and beliefs conflict with one another.	distorted	1
when i trying to get rid of my bad thoughts which is continuously coming to my mind –i can't.	distorted	1
she says i am just looking for stuff…but i feel like i have a reason to suspect her of cheating.	distorted	1
i am leaving for university in around 3 months, i think his family think i am a bad influence on him.	distorted	1
i thought of breaking up with him but have been staying on because i'm afraid he will resort to self-harm to cope with the pain or do something more terrible.	distorted	1
i stopped going to school in the 8th grade because i became very depressed and i had a lot of issues with the other kids.	distorted	1
i'm very confused, and have never thought i'd be put in this position.	distorted	1
i know that i did nothing so bad and i would forgive them if things where the opposite, but i can't stop thinking that i messed up, it doesn't matter how much i want to stop, i can't.	distorted	1
i hear something telling me i'm a loser and there's no point in trying.	distorted	1
sometimes i do things and don't remember them, i don't know if this is did i didn't have a bad childhood or anything, i asked my mother and she says i don't have another personality that i need to stop.	distorted	1
in the dream, my abuser was raping me, and in the weird way dreams are, i was my abuser's wife, only i knew it was me he was raping.	distorted	1
now i'm in college and still having almost all the same problems.	distorted	1
i was 13 at the time and i kept my sadness inside because i didn't want to worry my parents even more.	distorted	1
when someone tries to talk to me, i get so nervous about what they think of me that i end up seeming uninterested or maybe even snobby, probably.	distorted	1
is this depression? and if so, should i go see someone about it.	distorted	1
i can't get him out of my head no matter how hard i try to do so for the sake of my relationship.	distorted	1
it all started when i watched a video about marina joyce and her supposed mental illness, and being the idiot that i am looked up the symptoms and noticed something i sometimes do (thought blocking), but i stopped myself from doing that.	distorted	1
i find myself now beginning to feel stress because i am 26 with a 2 year old daughter and mounting debt but no clue what i want to do.	distorted	1
she is currently taking medication for depression and only has negative words to say when i speak with her.	distorted	1
but i can never bring up the guts to tell her about my suffering.	distorted	1
the worst part is that i'm a detective and have worked in the domestic violence unit before and i should be able to recognize whether or not this is going where i think and feel it might be, but i can't.	distorted	1
i can't go to school anymore, too many goddamn people staring at me and thinking about me, judging me all the time.	distorted	1
it's getting worse and its starting to hurt other people because of my confusion.	distorted	1
i'd rather work alone because i can't stand working with people because a lot of people drain my energy with being negative.	distorted	1
my mom doesn't ever listen to me when i tell her i'm sick, and i had school that day.	distorted	1
i'm always thinking of the kill.	distorted	1
anytime anyone says a bad thing about me, i feel insanely guilty and burst into tears either right there or later by myself.	distorted	1
i finally decided to close a portion of myself because i felt i could not beat it and if i didn't close off my emotions, i would have killed myself.	distorted	1
i have had thoughts of suicide but i never actually tried to kill myself.	distorted	1
i have read a lot on depression lately… the problem i am having is that she doesn't act this way with everyone.	distorted	1
i'm furious that i have to go to school and have actually considered starting a fire there.	distorted	1
no matter how hard i try i can't seem to focus.	distorted	1
do i go to my doctor and explain to him that i feel i have anxiety or am i just stupid for loving someone so much and wanted to spend so much time with them and that i give her 110% of everything heart mind and soul, i cry for her.	distorted	1
when i was…young, i was raped on a regular basis by my only guardian (he was not related) and occasionally sold for his self gain……….	distorted	1
back in october, i got my very first job, but it was for a haunted house so it only lasted a month.	distorted	1
i'm 17 and ever since i was young i have always had anxious feelings about those around me, and that i'm going to be murdered.	distorted	1
what should we do? neither of us like sneaking all round or lying to our kids.	distorted	1
i am devastated, because i love him and because i feel guilty that i'm the one who caused the whole problem.	distorted	1
my brother and i have not been raised luxuriously nor have we ever seen dearth of basic necessities.	non-distorted	0
i have tried and tried to figure out why i am holding such anger against them because they don't even have to do anything wrong and i am angry at them.	distorted	1
that he was being a jerk, and i did not have to tolerate that.	distorted	1
i have total faith in my therapist and i know he isn't going to over-react or freak out, i'm more worried about how i'm going to handle everything.	distorted	1
my self-esteem and self-respect are practically nonexistent; i think i'm ugly and dumb and worthless and a failure at everything i do.	distorted	1
i seek your advice because i feel lost.	non-distorted	0
as a boyfriend, i find myself constantly annoyed and angry with him because i feel like he doesn't understand me, and he says he feels the same.	distorted	1
i then gave it a year, my anxiety got worst, i rash out in hives, i shake, i don't want to go to school.	distorted	1
i hear voices that tell me i should cut myself or try to kill myself and the voice sounds evil,not human, i sometimes also hear like as though the telly or radio is going off but nothings on at the time.	distorted	1
for instance, i forced myself to feel bad and to think myself to be worthless.	distorted	1
it triggered anxiety in me because i thought that i was going crazy.	distorted	1
angry because i have no one.	distorted	1
i feel like we cannot enjoy healthy sex because of my demands.	distorted	1
it didn't seem to be very traumatic at all though.	distorted	1
i was abused as a child and thought i was over all of this.	distorted	1
during the relationship, he knew i was struggling with depression, and now i feel like it's only gotten worse.	distorted	1
i feel as if i need a plan because i feel lost.	distorted	1
i'm going trough a bad break up of 8 years and trying to cope with this on again off again relationship.	distorted	1
in high school and middle school, i had more of an excuse because i was working through very bad anxiety, depression and ocd.	distorted	1
i got married last year and unfortunately didn't last too long only for 9 months.	distorted	1
she's almost insulted that she has to drive me around and do things for me.	distorted	1
however, deep down, i wanted friends, i wanted to belong to a group, but my irrational fear of betrayal got the best o me.	distorted	1
i'm very very sad… i have no one to talk to.	distorted	1
my question is should i even pursue this relationship especially when he wouldn't fight for me.	distorted	1
i am 20 years old, and i never get turned on by anything rather than humiliation and torture such as whipping and stuff.	distorted	1
i try to seem unique but really i have no personality, i' m nothing but a bunch of stolen identities.	distorted	1
i wouldn't say that i'm depressed or have a mental illness that would make me hurt myself, but i just want a professional opinion on this because i regret cutting myself since someone is bound to see the scar at some point or another.	distorted	1
"i didn't mean to upset you,"" i still feel irritated and upset like nothing has changed, like he didn't apologize."	distorted	1
we hadn't spoken for 2 months before he killed himself, we were in a huge fight when it happened.	distorted	1
i don't know what to do because some of the arguments that we have are emotional, and i just leave because i don't want him to see me cry.	distorted	1
i am considered very successful and famous, i have millions of ideas and want to achieve it all, but i think of death and dying everyday.	distorted	1
i feel that something wrong with my hormones, because i just feel too much.	distorted	1
would i hurt my girlfriend if i ever had one? am i prey or predator? i guess i'm a psychpath and that's why they all used me.	distorted	1
he later said that he overreacted and should have considered my feelings more.	distorted	1
"why does he run from me but give himself to other casual girls who never had to ""earn"" that from him? i know he is confused and i'm giving him space but i'm so tired of the confusion."	distorted	1
it feels like he's fighting as hard as he can to avoid letting go completely.	distorted	1
in my life i have talked to a lot of guys only took a few serious but never had a serious relationship with them and got my feelings hurt by them.	distorted	1
i should be worrying about school.	distorted	1
i don't consider myself depressed, but i feel so careless at times and life is just passing me by.	distorted	1
he has lied about where she lives, if i have to work late , you can bet he is going to meet her for drinks.	distorted	1

i started hurting myself because of thinking i have to punish myself for the things she had made me do.	distorted	1
i have very dark and depressing thoughts and i often miss school because i can't event make my self get out of bed.	distorted	1
i was in pain, and a little short with him, because i will not be dragged into despair while under so many other pressures that i must overcome.	distorted	1
my parents have said many times that i'm cold blooded because i don't feel sad or pity when people die in terrorist attack like they do, i really don't understand why i should, it's not me.	distorted	1
he also said that's he's been hearing voices who are not his mother, not constantly, that are always negative or fear based (they're lying, run, don't touch that).	distorted	1
it wasn't that i complied because i wanted to please her, i was just too exhausted to defend myself any further because every time i made an attempt toward independence, she layered on the guilt or threatened.	distorted	1
i feared that there's nothing after this life.	distorted	1
i've always struggled to cope with these things, but i guess its messed me up because when attempting to self-diagnose using the internet my symptoms match up with everything from aspergers to all types of schizophrenia.	distorted	1
i have myself screaming in my head ssshh! i tell myself to shoosh all the time-out loud i don't know why.	distorted	1
i have never had a good relationship with him, he never changed my diaper and i thought he hated me and my brother.	distorted	1
it's the worst for my mom though, now she has one 'problem' kid (me), one with adhd and a jobless husband.	distorted	1
she feels she can't communicate with me as i am defensive and that i keep trying to talk my way out of issues and blame her for everything.	distorted	1

everyone says they are adults and i should let them make their own decisions and mistakes.	distorted	1
i'm always tired from not getting good nights sleep.	distorted	1
i understand that by doing this i am hurting his wife and i don't want to hurt anyone, it's not who i am, but i've never felt this way about someone before.	distorted	1
i also just feel like my girlfriend and parents are both not happy and very angry because of me.	distorted	1
i do not feel as if i am in the wrong body gender-wise, but that i should not be alive right now and i should not be embarking on any of the career paths that i am.	distorted	1
i try not to think about what happened most of the time because i just can't deal with it, i tend to cry and then get mad.	distorted	1
i usually prefer women but no one else was available and i thought < >.	distorted	1
i am at the point where i just want one of us to die, so i do not have to deal with her any more.	distorted	1
never had friends and i am a outcast.	distorted	1
i do not want to be around people, and if i have to it usually triggers a panic attack.	distorted	1
i'm 12 and my mom always picking fights and she yells at me at least once a day.	distorted	1
even though i have these terrifying thoughts of killing myself or someone else, i know i won't ever really do it.	distorted	1
i get sad, angry, and don't know what to do at all.	distorted	1
the worst part was my hand would shake so much sometimes, that if i was holding a cup, liquid would spill out of it.	distorted	1
i find it hard to do anything because my mind is consumed with the fear of losing a limb.	distorted	1
now i'm having thoughts about eating disorders, calories, all my problem areas, etc.	distorted	1
i work from home and it's difficult because i am also watching the kids.	non-distorted	0
my self-confidence lowered in time and now i feel like empty shell and completely worthless as human.	distorted	1
i also noticed a change in my thinking patterns as my brain is never calm, i'm always imagining conversations with friends and family in my head or singing a song and obsessing over schizophrenia to the point i was making myself have paranoid schizophrenic thoughts, which could have possibly been my real thoughts.	distorted	1
we broke up because i couldn't take it anymore.	distorted	1
i think that me acting this way towards my father mainly has to do with the fact that my mother and father have serious marital problems, and me and my mother constantly talk about them and as time went on i started to get irritated by him because i'm on her side.	distorted	1
i am now completely devastated and i just don't know what to do.	distorted	1
technically he's been medicated for 10 years, never off antipsychotics, but his delusions are always a problem.	distorted	1
i felt like a total loser why would i ever do that?? i asked myself.	distorted	1
i also don't like to hang out with a lot of people because i feel so weak when i'm around with a lot of people.	distorted	1
"he treated me as if i had no opinions or will, i remember he used to tell me ""don't ask, you are only here to obey!""."	distorted	1
the only medications i am taking for mental health are zoloft for depression, anxiety, and occasional panic (i was placed on the medication before the psychosis).	distorted	1
she's trying to keep me from going where she did, telling me that mom only said stuff out of anger and she didn't mean it.	distorted	1
i am a 49 year old female in a relationship with a very jealous and controlling man.	distorted	1
he approached me today and stated he thinks he is depressed.	distorted	1
i always had anxiety as a child but was able to mask it as i thought people would think there was something wrong with me.	distorted	1
in many ways, although my childhood was scary and violent, i wish i could be twelve again – maybe that way i wouldn't have to face reality of aging and death.	distorted	1
i, completely shocked, confronted my boyfriend about it and he cried and said he hadn't told anyone about it and didn't know what to do.	distorted	1
before, i had suicidal thoughts and ideations, but only thought seriously about them on occasion, whereas now, it seems to be the only way to end everything.	distorted	1
my lose skin can probably only be corrected with surgery which i will never be able to afford.	distorted	1
i am a young woman suffering from treatment-resistant atypical anxious depression.	distorted	1
i didn't do it because i can't bear hearing the both of them tell me how much they hate each other.	distorted	1
it was a week earlier when i had a fight with my father i wanted to kill him, i even took the knife off the shelf but thought i would be in trouble, because i had learnt never to kill a person we know, because we will get under prime suspect.	distorted	1
i feel like i have to fight my brain to stop overthinking.	distorted	1
i haven't had a particularly rough time in the past, i have had perhaps one ex that maybe cheated on me but i was never sure.	distorted	1
i have a bad problem controling my impulses, and im quite reckless, not in a way of hurting myself but, doing things without thinking about the consequences.	distorted	1
i have worst case of white coat hypertension.	distorted	1
ever since then her family has just disliked me because they feel i'm not good enough for her or will ruin her life.	distorted	1
only problem i have is my mother.	distorted	1
of course i am completely frightened.	distorted	1
i never had a job cause i'm terrified of working.	distorted	1
i wanted a place that i didn't have to fear of having to start over again, ever and yet here i am.	distorted	1
"i use to joke about my husband being ""paranoid"" and always ""assuming"" the worst."	distorted	1
i am worried no one will take me seriously.	distorted	1
and than i get mad because i don't want to eat but he doesn't want to stop talking and i yell at him to stop and sometimes i start hitting myself because i'm mad at myself.	distorted	1
i feel i have been in the hellish grip of a major depression.	distorted	1

and sometimes i remember events from my childhood -5 to 7 years old- and feel bad and worthless *as a kid.	distorted	1
it's gotten to the point where i won't even help my mom cook because it always terrifies me when my mom cuts meat.	distorted	1
no, i am not going to suicide and never tried that but i kinda feel like it is going to be a traffic accident or someone will kill me.	distorted	1
i feel awful, inferior, useless and worthless.	distorted	1

i have never felt like this before and don't understand why i feel this way now, but a few things that he has said and done over the years has really stuck in my head and now that my daughter is becoming a woman i am worried.	distorted	1
i blow up at my children when they ask me to do something, i'm easily annoyed, its hard for me to have a gathering at my house because the anxiety gets too out of control if i have to make coffee, have snacks or even a conversation without getting up and walking around aimlessly to do something, i dont know what.	distorted	1
he's perhaps the only person that knows everything about me–i told him about my depression, he obviously knows about the prostitution–but he uses it against me when we have arguments.	distorted	1
i hated him more, because my mother died of giving birth and here he is having a new wife.	distorted	1
from india: i have a bad relationship with my mother.	distorted	1
the psychologist told me i was having problems because i was so unstablyouith living circumstances.	distorted	1

i used to be a volcano trying to erupt under ice, but now i'm a car that won't stop running, and the only thing that keeps me going is adrenaline.	distorted	1
it's humiliating and is uncomfortable for everyone involved.	distorted	1
i yell at my son that is 2years old and i hate myself for that cause he doesnt know better.	distorted	1

my siblings and i have always thought he was semi-unstable, but recently he's gotten much worse.	distorted	1
i kept my feelings to myself because i didn't want my family to worry.	distorted	1
this may not sound like much but i feel so depressed and i try, i really do, i just don't know why i don't get things in return.	distorted	1
by hurting i mean only pinching, or slapping or scratching (basically anything that can make them suffer and cry a bit) but i don't feel any greater harm.	distorted	1
my mother went through a terrible depression in her early 40's.	distorted	1
it was my way of curbing my depressive episodes and the suicidal thoughts that never cease haunting me.	distorted	1
i have noticed that my emotions are starting to ignore everything.	distorted	1
i didn't know what to do because i feared i would lose my job and make things even worse.	distorted	1
i have also insulin resistance and tachycardia (they are aware), so i don't want to trouble them with something as big as depression and anxiety that may just be all up in my head and possibly not be true.	distorted	1
i feel like if im living in this house with someone who sees me a certain way and accuses me of being someone im not, the only way out is to kill myself.	distorted	1
i have always been suicidal so i can't relate to him.	distorted	1
when i asked them about it, they said that they had: – a weird want to hurt people that they do not know.	distorted	1
i have been diagnosed with major depression with psychosis truth is however i'm faking it because i am afraid to tell the truth which is i have no feelings toward people.	distorted	1
i was devastated because i never ever thought something like this could happen.	distorted	1
i grew up with my parents thinking i was lazy and had no motivation of doing anything but that wasn't the case they just didn't know that i was just hiding the way i was feeling from them because i knew they wouldn't understand.	distorted	1
well according to what my aunt said they knew eachother for only 2 months or so b4 they got married! the story started when i heard my mom sweet talking on the phone, i first panicked & when i asked her who it was she said juss a friend but i knew she was lying .	distorted	1
starting from last year he's been undergoing ever more increasing depression.	distorted	1
i haven't told no one because i know they will say i am stupid for doing it.	distorted	1
i had a very traumatic childhood being given up by my mum who couldn't look after me for her own mental problems which i still hate her for deep down, in and out of care all my life.	distorted	1
this makes me sad because i don't want to be the cause of someone's unhappiness and i know i need help.	distorted	1
the problem i am having (which was also around before we got married) is that my wife continuously gets mad at me for reasons (in her perspective) that have to do with my not being caring enough, not understanding her, not being willing to listen to her.	distorted	1
"he repeatedly punched and broke my dashboard in my vehicle while screaming ""shutup you stupid b*tch!!"" when i told him once that he should go easier on his father when they had a disagreement."	distorted	1
who am i? why the hell do i feel so disconnected from everything… including myself? i can't sleep at night because i can't shake these questions out of my mind… and when i do sleep, the same questions haunt me in my nightmares… i'm lost….	distorted	1
i see a therapist and i don't really think that is helping much, partly because i find it so difficult to talk to anyone about this stuff let alone people i don't know very well and because i find it hard to expresses the such strong feelings of sadness, self hatred and guilt that i feel.	distorted	1
to clarify it's nothing sexual, i don't engage in that sort of behavior, and i still feel unhappy over negative attention- but i enjoy that feeling of unhappiness.	distorted	1
s: ever since i can remember, i have had people telling me to sit down and stop fidgeting.	distorted	1
i have no reason to be this neurotic because there isn't a diagnosable mental illness i can have and i cant think back to any past trauma that might have caused it but its driving me crazy and i feel like this has to stop now because its so frivolous and ridiculous.	distorted	1
he's a great guy who never got angry at me or furious because of my ocd (afraid of germs), he was supporting and even changed his behavior in public to avoid me having a panic attack.	distorted	1
i stopped eating and no one even came to check on me.	distorted	1
i nag and nitpick over every little thing and he feels horrible because there isn't anything he can do about it.	distorted	1

it feels like i am constantly on the verge of a complete panic attack.	distorted	1
"he is sometimes inappropriate with his flirting, and when i talk with some of the girls he knows, he asks me ""what we talked about,"" and now i'm paranoid that he's hiding things from me."	distorted	1
i'll think a shadow is a moving bug, and once i thought i saw smoke in the dining room, but nothing was cooking or on fire.	distorted	1
i can't speak my mind, i feel i can't ask for anything because i'm bothering people.	distorted	1
she obviously get's angry and disappointed with me because i don't want to eat.	distorted	1
i'm not diagnosed with anything, my mom says depression is a phase every teenage girl goes through and that it will just past me.	distorted	1
faking is impossible because i don't understand what or how to do it since i don't understand what is appropriate.	distorted	1
every single time something happens now, he will cut himself, snort pills, and threaten to kill himself, or repeatedly ask me if he can die or how he should kill himself.	distorted	1
i find myself wanting to binge on alcohol often and it's a struggle to stop at 1 glass ever, even though i hate feeling drunk.	distorted	1
she never wanted him, she just went along with it but now knows she was duped and i feel so angry and hateful.	distorted	1
recently, i have been stressed which has caused what symptoms of anxiety i have to skyrocket.	distorted	1
now when she gets angry at our parrot for making a mess or being too loud, she hits the cage but never the bird.	distorted	1
when i was little i couldn't watch the news because i would become upset and always think about the people who died.	distorted	1
i am a shy (male) senior student in high school unsure of my plans of what to do in college and how to get a scholarship in the art world.	distorted	1
i saw john cena, followed him, and came to a huge nest of killer bees; he was riding a four-wheeler and was making the bees mad.	distorted	1
i guess it is an anxiety attack.	distorted	1
but i do do the following: worry a lot, become concerned that people don't like me or are talking about me even though i know its irrational and makes no sense all of this worsened after my recent move.	distorted	1
i was and am completely furious.	distorted	1
we have always suspected that it was more than pms, she's practically an alcoholic and her behaviour isn't cyclical as you would suspect from pms.	distorted	1
i feel more isolated than ever and just have aching loneliness.	distorted	1
he will question me on everything and i have to prove everything he has doubt in.	distorted	1
i think someone says my name or whispers but no one did.	distorted	1
i would go outside and smoke at 3 am in the morning, the parking lot was empty, would still hear them, but, no one was there.	distorted	1
ever since i can remember, starting from when my mom and dad got divorced, i was ill treated by my relatives on my mother's side.	distorted	1
i am too scared to sleep now because i'm afraid that one day i might not wake up in time and will die in my sleep.	distorted	1
i lied and gave him a very low number, because i knew he was a jealous man.	distorted	1
i became depressed, i wouldn't have an appetite, i would get bad grades, and i would sleep all the time.	distorted	1
drawing is one of the only things i can do where my head isn't a buzz with disaster scenariorizing.	distorted	1
it all started with losing sleep the night before an exam and had very severe negative thoughts later.	distorted	1
it has gotten to the point where life has been complete hell and the only solution i can think of is violence (i won't go into detail).	distorted	1
but to me, if i don't = i will fail.	distorted	1
i genuinely don't think i could ever hurt her, she is the most important thing in the world to me.	distorted	1
my parents have done so much for me, and i know they have tried their best at raising me, but, i can't help but blame them for how i turned out and feel angry at them.	distorted	1
should he be looked at? usually my son will throw tantrums that we feel are normal for a 5 year old.	distorted	1
i have felt pretty good without the meds but here latley i am back to crying for no reason and only able to think about what needs to be done instead of doing it.	distorted	1
im annoying and i should be alone forever.	distorted	1
"i never knew he felt so disgusted with me that he would describe my having children as ""shitting out kids"" to other people when he talks to them."	distorted	1
that night i cried myself to sleep because i was scared i didn't understand what was going on with my brother or if he was going to be okay.	distorted	1
i have thoughts that i may be making up my problems to get attention or that nothing's wrong with me because some days everything feels normal but 90% of the time i feel horrible(memory problems,lack of purpose,difficulty concentrating,worrying,slightly suicidal).	distorted	1
killing myself often crossed my mind and i also had thoughts of violence, not only directed at myself, but at other people as well.	distorted	1
i also hate it when we have to give a presentation for class.	distorted	1
i never found my behavior weird until i was put on anti depressants.	distorted	1
it's gotten to the point where i doubt everything i thought i once knew about myself.	distorted	1
i thought it was all my fault, even if i'd been told it wasn't.	distorted	1
and im afraid because i know how bad i feel, and i dont want to be locked away forever.	distorted	1
but i feel like anytime he gets upset with me or we have an argument and he goes out with his friends, i fear he would hurt me again.	distorted	1
i'd rather stay in my room away from everyone, even my own family but now it's starting to bother them.	distorted	1
i only have fragments of memories of being abused as a kid.	distorted	1
the other night she came in and was mad that she couldn't be beside her dad because i was, so she whjned and punched me in the back until i left.	distorted	1
she's always stressed and has to deal with my two brothers who both have issues and are seeing therapists which are expensive and we don't have a lot of money.	distorted	1
looking back on our courtship, i can see a few warning signs that i wasn't mature enough to recognize at the time, but he never acted quite this rageful towards me in the past.	distorted	1
from france: i have contacted you because my boyfriend started to see a psychotherapist since last autumn and i was skeptical from the start but i couldn't forbid him this.	distorted	1
when it is at its worst, i can hardly get out a rational thought, it just keeps building on itself.	distorted	1
empathy is difficult for me, i find that i have to force emotions out of myself to at least appear sane to others.	distorted	1
i broke up with him a few weeks after our 1 year because i couldn't take the struggles anymore, and he was physically sick.	distorted	1
"also, because she and her soon to be ex-husband always had trouble living life as ""adults"" should and could never get and keep a place to live."	distorted	1
i sat in my mothers living room at one time screaming and crying while home alone because i was surrounded by fire.	distorted	1
"it's not like i'm gonna just come out and say, ""i want to go back to my therapist because i want to hurt people,"" because then i don't know what would happen."	distorted	1
i would never hurt a fly let alone act on these thoughts but i wanna know why i'm having them? i heard it's from ocd and anxiety, and i know i have anxiety.	distorted	1
i worry that if he doesn't get help soon he will do something silly as he just hates his life and feels he is a complete failure, i find it difficult to help him as i disagree with what he is blaming his problems on.	distorted	1
i then got on depression medication again because i did not want to live that life style anymore.	distorted	1
i'd never feel like that, if i wasn't guilt-tripping myself, but in that moment, suicide seems like a pretty good idea – because i will feel like i'm unworthy of living because of all my screw-ups and like it'd keep me from screwing up again or from hurting someone else ever again.	distorted	1
i've always got a headache, or stomach ache, or just generally feel ill.	distorted	1
she's often pessimistic and only thinks about how thing's effect her.	distorted	1
first off i haven't killed anyone yet because i'm not stupid.	distorted	1
i feel like i have always suffered from depression but i'm not 100% sure.	distorted	1
while my dad, of course, is not completely innocent my mom seems to be having mental problems that are the basis for the arguing.	distorted	1
i don't know what do i exactly feel but it always pricks me, makes me want to cry and then it leads to making me feel useless because whatever i try to do ends up wrong.	distorted	1
in 22 years, i still have only had maybe a dozen memories of my childhood prior to the accident.	distorted	1
i don't understand that since i am 41, my brother should have no say in what i do and don't do with my money, but when i try to tell him, he gets all mad at me and says that i am selfish.	distorted	1
he is good-looking and has an amazing personality but even thinking about meeting him or having a relationship with him makes me sick not because of him…because of me and i regret registering to the site.	distorted	1
everything's been a mess now and she's changed so much.	distorted	1
this is killing me because i don't want to be with anybody else! he is all i think of and the only man i want to ever be with.	distorted	1
half the time my mom would wait til he left the kitchen then throw it away, then they'd fight about it all the time.	distorted	1
i am afraid if this continues i might lose needing my mom in my life ever which i feel guilty about.	distorted	1
"with each new, horrible thing he says to me, i think to myself ""this is the last straw, i will not put up with this anymore."	distorted	1
and i'm the worse iv ever been.	distorted	1
of course i was told i was a horrible mother for even thinking of asking him to leave.	distorted	1
her father was always drunk and she witnessed him beat her brothers because he was jealous that his wife (my mom's mother) was paying too much attention to them.	distorted	1
i have always had a fear of death, after when i was little we lost one of the family pets (we treat them more like family members) and ever since then i have had these strange, at random, panics about me dying, and that i just don't want my story to end.	distorted	1
i can't stand the thought of being fat again especially because i know how hard it was for my old horse to carry me around when i was overweight and every time i reach a goal weight i set another that's less.	distorted	1
it's sending me in fits of hysteria!! in the mornings i don't want to get up because i'm afraid of being stressed out.	distorted	1
i haven't told my therapist about this because i don't know if it's just my anxiety or if i actually have the disorder.	distorted	1
i feel bad because i thought i'm all he ever wants and dreamed of but it doesn't feel that way.	distorted	1
he told me when we broke up that when he thinks about his future, he doesn't see me in it anymore, and as much as he wanted us to work he just can't do it anymore.	distorted	1
i often question why i do anything, i have no energy, nor motivation to do anything, i'm never hungry, i just feel weird and i always have a headache.	distorted	1
this started a couple of months ago when i bought a whole new wardrobe which i needed because i have lost 77 pounds in the last year.	distorted	1
he doesn't blame me for the issues any more and actually admits to the manipulation and abuse.	distorted	1
i quit trying to talk to him about my hurt feelings because i feared it would just make him withdraw more, and possibly end the relationship.	distorted	1
i feel so bad because i'm an awful friend for wanting to drop her but i just don't want to talk about mental illness.	distorted	1
it's not a body image thing it's more i feel like a dick doing it and it seems very contrived & superficial but the only one suffering as a result of not doing it is me.	distorted	1
all i ever think about is dying but i think i'm getting worse.	distorted	1
if my shoes feel weird, if i can't find something, just setting up my computer, or for no reason at all, can cause me to become irritated.	distorted	1
she was in a bad place with her family dealing with a lot of anxiety, depression and emotional issues.	distorted	1
i feel very depressed and worthless.	distorted	1
i cannot get my therapists to focus of the pstd problems (flashbacks and nigtmares and severe anxiety) and they want me on an anti-psychotic even though there's never been any hint of a problem with the paxil setting off the bipolar.	distorted	1
i always thought if i try harder it will be better, but with me my mistakes remind the same.	distorted	1
after the bad experience he got into alot of trouble and i feel that he hates me now because i told the police on him.	distorted	1
at the age of 25 i approached my ob/gyn about mood swings and lack of sexual drive and she prescribed me zoloft for post partum because my youngest daughter was about 8 months old.	distorted	1
sometime i am good but sometimes suddenly it comes back and i have panic attacks or very anxious time.	distorted	1
what if i just masked it? i feel completely empty, i feel so unloved.	distorted	1
what is your advice on what i should do if i ever come face to face with him at the gym again? ignore him and leave? i have done some research and think this man may have borderline personality disorder.	distorted	1
it's all caused me so much pain.	distorted	1
in our second year he was diagnosed with a severe depression that he must have had for a while then.	distorted	1
i can't stop lying about everything.	distorted	1
ever since i was about 15 i have struggled with ever-worsening depression to the point where i was frequently self-harming and not moving for days.	distorted	1
this has made all my self-loathing and guiltiness and embarrassment worse and i feel like i'm failing academically and also failing as a person.	distorted	1
all complete with the thoughts that if i didn't, something bad would happen.	distorted	1
it was crippling anxiety my family had no idea what to do and neither did i.	distorted	1
i have a broken hip, my own fault, when i told her she cried and said she would come to the hospital immediately then talked only about her relationship for 45 minutes and didn't come.	distorted	1
me and my stepdad has nicknamed it broken mirror disorder because my problem doesn't match mpd because i don't have amnesia and i'm aware of everything i do, i thought it was a split personality but my mom says it's not split personality disorder.	distorted	1
when i'm in school i think i'm doing just fine then get a letter saying i need to take summer school because i failed my classes.	distorted	1
it scares me to think that i'm only 13 and i am having these types of dark thoughts.	distorted	1
"if i smell something bad, or something i dont like, i have to ""push out"" the bad scent out of my nose three times and breathe in ""good smells"" once or twice."	distorted	1
from that moment i felt shame hit the drugs and the streets, constant rejected and scapegoated by family, then at other times used as the parents only source of support.	distorted	1
my theropiet my i was a teen said that she thinks i didn't cry because i knew no one would come anyway.	distorted	1
this isnt just a lovers tiff, it is a life threatening situation and i have no support and no indication of what i should do and, more importantly, what i should not do.	distorted	1
i'm never happy about any of my achievements and i think nothing is important in my life.	distorted	1
and i lie awake at night thinking about it and how i never wanted it and i should have just cried or kept saying no.	distorted	1
i hate myself because i'm different.	distorted	1
i hated them and wanted nothing to do with them and tried to suppress them, but was convinced i was evil.	distorted	1
i can't have sex when i'm sober, because i have horrible anxiety that i am doing everything wrong.	distorted	1
i can't stop, i think about rape all the time, it's always in the back of my mind, and whenever i hear about a rape scene in a movie, i look it up right away, even though i know that doing so will hurt me.	distorted	1
first i was ok with it then became very anxious of all that happened, i couldn't sleep and became very tired.	distorted	1
my boyfriend's mother seemed to like me at first but since he and i have moved in together she has been my worst enemy.	distorted	1
but pain and tears never stop.	distorted	1
i don't feel able to talk to anyone about this because i know it makes me seem immature, but i want to stop these behaviours to give my parents a bit of a break.	distorted	1
we were never allowed to be sad, or mad, or anything else that wasn't happy.	distorted	1
i also haven't been able to tell her that i feel so angry or depressed, because i think she may think that i have no reason for such feeling/thinking and it was my choice to be like this (this is what my mom believes and tells me).	distorted	1
nothing has resolved my depression.	distorted	1
my mom is a single parent,my dad died when i was only 6 months old.	non-distorted	0
it sounds so irresponsible, spoiled, and childish which is why it's so hard for me to talk about because i can't convey the way it feels to me inside.	distorted	1
"i didn't know that was putting ""me"" on the side to give what others wanted; ultimately a bad move."	distorted	1
he is also completely paranoid and accuses people of being out to get him.	distorted	1
he didn't ever force me, just bribed, so was it still sexual abuse? or was it at first, and then it became consensual at some point when i knew more? and how unusual is this, and does it mean something's wrong with me? sometimes i think there's something wrong with me when i think back on it.	distorted	1
well, yes it is stress because i do not feel like myself for half of each month and am ruining my relationships with my unexplained depression and lashing anger.	distorted	1
i am a 35 year old woman and going through a depressing phase of my life.	distorted	1
i am completely alone, no family and few uninvolved friends, so my state of mood never affects anyone.	distorted	1
he's broken up with me on numerous ocassions because he can't handle my always acussing him of things i have.	distorted	1
i have no reason to want this, i am not bullied, nor is there anyone i outright hate and want to make dead.	distorted	1
it is obvious that my father is causing a lot of distress but there is nothing we could do about it, we can't ask him to return to where he'd come from because he is very ill and cannot take care of himself, he has no where else to go.	distorted	1
i wasnt brought up in a abusive family and i have never had a traumatised childhood.	non-distorted	0
i'm always sad, i could be happy for one minute then back to sad.	distorted	1
now i'm fat i do everything but i can lose some weight everyday my weight is changing.	distorted	1
will he ever hurt me? he bought a gun recently and this really puts me on edge.	distorted	1
i don't know what to do, i want to talk to her but this never happened before so i'm kind of scared, i don't know how she's going to react.	distorted	1
i'm honestly trying my best to be a better person but no matter how much i try, these negative thoughts and feelings won't go away.	distorted	1
for months i kept thinking i had something wrong with my brain, because i would have constant headaches and intrusive thoughts and the paranoia/anxiety over everything.	distorted	1
i cut myself about 10 times each night on my hips where no one can see and i tend to find myself crying for no reason.	distorted	1
the problem is that now that i never play it anymore i feel a very strong need to play it and since no other game can replace it i feel unhappy and unfulfilled.	distorted	1
i have never had a job and i want one, and i want to go back to school, but i'm so terrified of my anxiety and depression and paranoia getting in the way.	distorted	1
next, i have trouble concentrating and communicating with my fiance and family because my head is so cluttered with thoughts.	distorted	1
i can't help but think i'm going to be like this for the rest of my life, miserable, and pathetic and i should put my self out of my misery already.	distorted	1
i often cried out suddenly and fight to my bf by telling about them but he never fight me back.	distorted	1
whatever it is, these problems with sharp objects, torure scenerios and enclosed places must stop but i don't know how.	distorted	1
i question reality and get confused about the concept of time and sometimes i completely forget who i am.	distorted	1
i have no friends because i am embarrassed of myself and my decisions and dont want to expose myself as a fraud to anyone.	distorted	1
is this some kind of possible mental disorder? should i see someone? also in the last few days i have had trouble sleeping 4 hours tops some nights.	distorted	1
my bf mentioned to me that is bothers him that he has never been to my house and my living situation bothers him but says he will not make an excuse for what he has done he says he made a mistake and its not going to happen again.	distorted	1
i remember my dad raped me in the kitchen and i blacked out because i couldn't breathe.	distorted	1
he asks me why i cant just accept that it is what turns him on but it hurts because i should be enough.	distorted	1
i'm feeling hurt and abandoned and this reminds me that i can't trust anyone ever again.	distorted	1
i don't know what to do since i have no medical insurance, no money, and medications have never made a difference in the past.	distorted	1
but that now first kicked off the huge fear of a major depression that could change my attitude one day towards the fact that i don't want to die.	distorted	1
he also just refused to see the severity of anything that happened in my life–when i was admitted to the hospital with unexplained chest pain, muscle weakness, and neurological symptoms, he remained convinced that it was low blood sugar because i don't eat healthily (it turned out to be an acute stress reaction).	distorted	1
please help me to overcome my meaningless fear and the big one of the big problems for me is i'm not very happy with my physique… i'm a very skinny guy and of course, i just want to get rid of this skinny shit… pls help me what should i do…….	distorted	1
i did not tell my best friends immediately about the betrayal because i cared more about my ex.	distorted	1
i often plot to kill myself, but never go through with it due to family being home.	distorted	1
but, when they aren't mad; everything is fine.	distorted	1
the thing is that every time i start fasting i can't complete the goal that i set and it makes me hate myself even more.	distorted	1
i have never cut or tried to harm myself in any way.	non-distorted	0
"he gets furious, & says, ""i don't care if they screw up, & it's got nothing to do with you, so drop it!"" so after this problem description, i want to know what i can do? i have a couple alcoholics in my family as well."	distorted	1
the depression has been awful for the past 2 years, a way that in never was before.	distorted	1
from iran: i am very frustrated right now because my 57-year-old mom is very depressed, which by the way is not a new topic, yet it bothers me so much.	distorted	1
and never in my life had anything made more sense than this fear, it fits my past and current actions and thoughts exactly… and i know for a fact that this is one of the things i may be suffering from, if not the only thing.	distorted	1
i'm having trouble coaping with this that i always come running back to him because i miss him, but then again we fight again.	distorted	1
she's always on the phone to other people, got a massive extended family and it's too the point where i'm just ignored and neglected, despite me making time for her.	distorted	1
i'm always worried about having a heart attack.	distorted	1
i come here seeking advice on whether i should see a psychologist or not and, most importantly, why should i bother doing that.	distorted	1
a day never goes by where i don't think something is wrong with me.	distorted	1
i am scared of going out and see this people, because if i see them i always have crisis and there was one time i thought i would lose my control.	distorted	1
what makes it worse is i work with him and we act like nothing happened it is eating me up inside and i'm confused.	distorted	1
people around me tries very hard to help, but i feel it is useless.	distorted	1
"however, she makes me anxious as well, up to the point where i fear getting hurt or running into problems, not because i'm trying to take care of myself, but because i'm afraid she will say ""i told you so""."	distorted	1
i'm tired of wanting her back every day.	distorted	1
from that day, i can't stop thinking about all my family dying in a horrible way.	distorted	1
i also have a social worker , who has tried to help my mum in every was but she isn't accepting anything and now i have been told i just need to prepare myself for her killing herself.	distorted	1
i guess i'm mainly saddened that he was only 17 and he had a family that he left behind.	distorted	1
because of my anger issues, when my wife asks me a question or makes a statement to me, she feels that when i respond to her, i have a an attitude, or i am edgy in my responses.	distorted	1
it's become a problem for us because he's expressed that he feels he will never be able to do enough for me.	distorted	1
in the process of getting help i was diagnosed with adhd which made sense looking back at my behavior towards school, but i know that has nothing to do with my relationship fear.	distorted	1
i think that there are people who have it worse than i do, and that i should just stop thinking about it.	distorted	1
but i don't know how to tell my parents to just leave it alone, let us grow apart, we have nothing in common and just shouldn't be talking.	distorted	1
i have never dated a man who didn't lie or cheat or do something else bad to me.	distorted	1
my family is dysfunctional and after visiting my family this summer i have felt depressed and not motivated to do more than i have to.	distorted	1
i also get very anxious when i know he's coming home soon, because i know it is going to be constant critiques.	distorted	1
over the years i started to detach myself for him because i felt unhappy.	distorted	1
despite being in a few relationships, i have never had romantic feelings for anyone.	distorted	1
i always thought that that was just a phase and it would go away with time but everything got worse when i entered middle school, i started having strong body image issues, i even got an eating disorder for two years.	distorted	1
i feel like it's mostly gone away, only slight depersonalization and derealization and anxiousness (which worsens when i feel anxiousness), and i'm terrified of marijuana now.	distorted	1
if i try to tell her what worked for me, she immediately rejects anything i have to offer.	distorted	1
i don't understand what makes me such a bad person that i am that unlikeable.	distorted	1
broke up with my bf only because of long distance and can't think of marriage as we are still young in our careers 3.	distorted	1
my father is a lazy alcoholic and he was emotionally absent, my mother loved me a lot but her sharp criticism destroyed my self esteem and the fact that she didn't care about me very deeply, but only on the surface.	distorted	1
i don't know what's wrong with me, from the age or 12 i have been unhappy, i was bullied as a child and have had weight issues all my life.	distorted	1
not to mention my weight changes, i'd go from binge eating to nearly starving myself because i just wasn't hungry any more.	distorted	1
do you think a therapist will help me through the anxiety and depression without making me address the eating issues?  i am not experiencing any ill health effects and just want to lose 7 more pounds.	distorted	1
everyone keeps telling me i'm stupid to stay i just don't know what is keeping me there.	distorted	1
and we had sex, he only wore a condom part of the time which terrified me but i was in too much shock to say anything.	distorted	1
i feel like at times things can be good but right when i think that, arguing or something happens.	distorted	1
nothing has happened so far but i am afraid that someday i might no longer be able to control it anymore.	distorted	1
over the last week i have this screaming thought in my head that i am gay, and i can't seem to get rid of it no matter how hard i try.	distorted	1
if i get injured or sick i try to deal with it myself so my mother and brother don't have to deal with me.	distorted	1
but my parents refuse to let me go back home to my daughter's father and we want to get back together i need some advice on how to go about everything.	distorted	1
he said he wanted to see us at fathers day and never showed up and i was very upset.	distorted	1
i consider him my conscience but he says he is a very powerfull being who has gotten tied with the wrong person.	distorted	1
i'm always fighting with my parents, especially my dad; he yells at me a lot.	distorted	1
it has gotten to the point where people take a quick glance at me whenever they see me because they think i am going to take an offensive look at them.	distorted	1
saying that i'm pathetic out loud only makes me more pathetic.	distorted	1
"getting back home she pouts and ignored me until my father comes home and she starts complaining about how i am ""so disrespectful"" and ""should be punished."	distorted	1
i hardly ever feel sad or stressed.	distorted	1
once the car was completely underwater, i began to have trouble breathing and immediately woke up, gasping for air.	distorted	1
however, it seemed no matter how i responded, he would find fault with it, and i felt like i was walking on eggshells when he was around because i never knew what would irritate him next.	distorted	1
sometimes i plan out how i would kill myself even though i know i would never do it.	distorted	1
my husband feels it won't do any good for him to come here but will only stress us out (me in particular).	distorted	1
my daughter was only nine when she died.	distorted	1
i was also not eating, i was always feeling down and sad, and i couldn't sleep at night.	distorted	1
since new years day (4 days ago) i have been experiencing bad insomnia, severe panic attacks and dissociation like never before.	distorted	1
i have never talked to any of my close friends about these things because they come to me with their problems looking for advice, and i don't want to burden them with my problems.	distorted	1
well a couple months ago i began to feel the same way again due to stress from finances, relationship problems and such and i want know what i should do.	distorted	1
i don't know if i'm right about being paranoid and should do something about my mom, or i'm sick.	distorted	1
so to start off my mom and i didn't always have a terrible relationship.	distorted	1
i don't feel angry, i'm not at all a serious person, i just laugh at horror movies or when im in pain.	non-distorted	0
no matter what i'm doing, or which role i'm fulfilling, i feel like a fake.	distorted	1
i am in college now, and the abuse has slowed down because i'm better at avoiding it.	non-distorted	0
i have to check around my room before i lie down, before and after turning off the lights! i can't be in the house alone even in the day time because i feel like being murdered is inevitable.	distorted	1
i know that i must have depression, because no matter what i do those feelings of helplessness towards myself keep coming back.	distorted	1
i'm still doubtful though because i am a sadomasochist, i like to get hurt as well as hurt people.	distorted	1
i have never had it diagnosed, i am too ashamed and fearful of being 'branded'.	distorted	1
i also am becoming angry far quicker than i ever have.	distorted	1
we have a lot of problems because i feel he's not affectionate enough towards me and i'm always seeking validation.	distorted	1
psychos think they are better than everyone else, maybe that's what i think, and maybe i am in early stages of becoming a serial killer / killer.	distorted	1
and it puts me into a helpless panic attack.	distorted	1
i don't know how to talk to him without us both feeling like horrible people and i don't know how to get over what happened when i feel like it's invalid for me to be upset at all about what happened, since it wasn't as bad as what many people experience.	distorted	1
the only reason it stopped was because he died.	distorted	1
sometimes she's say sorry so she knows she ignores me.	distorted	1
during our 6th month together, we had a big fight which led to me breaking up with him because i was frustrated with him.	distorted	1
"my parents are deniers of mental illness – the have a ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"" / ""you can't possibly have depression"" attitudes, so i always attributed my poor mental status to a character flaw."	distorted	1
i have no one to talk to, my sister is in just as bad shape as me so she hates me.	distorted	1
now i get stressed out around people even more (i think they see i'm pathetic) and i also get stressed out by myself now because i don't know what's wrong.	distorted	1
it made me question if i would ever be a danger to children or if that's what people will think.	distorted	1
i'm not sure if that is a result of, or perhaps the cause of my depression.	distorted	1
so i told him that i think he should meet my parents and he said okay but he sort freaked out when i told him to meet them the next day.	distorted	1
my social anxiety is worse than ever but i dont have general anxiety any more instead i just have paranoia.	distorted	1
but i am all of sudden having mildly delusional thoughts that r freaking me out.	distorted	1
i am worried he will end up arrested.	distorted	1
i can't really identify my moods because they're all so weird, and if i try to figure it out, it changes.	distorted	1
when i'm hyper, i harm no one, i don't spend too much or gamble or drink or do anything that could be considered damaging.	non-distorted	0
i feel he is putting too much pressure on me and i feel stressed but not only that.	distorted	1
as soon as i say something, i can't stop thinking about how stupid it sounded to everyone.	distorted	1
doesn't want to do anything, very lazy, always tired, seems depressed, angry, moody.	distorted	1
i have lost my motivation because i feel that no matter what i do, i am not making any progress towards my goal of having a fulfilling life.	distorted	1
so i haven't had family since leaving 25 years ago  my family was not a good unit with all sibling leaving in their teens to runaway from home.	distorted	1
my thoughts are always i mess, i cant speak well and i have no speech problems.	distorted	1
do you think his schizophrenia has something to do with his confusion? he kept telling me theres nothing wrong with me, but that he didn't know why or couldn't explain why he would cheat on me.	distorted	1
we broke up and i started to fix my life i was constantly in and out of the er because i would be so faint at work .	distorted	1
i feel trapped because i'm on a lease for another six months with him.	distorted	1
i cry for no reason very frequently, although i guess it must be because of all the reasons above.	distorted	1
the self harm started when i had a bad day at school or when i was simply feeling down.	distorted	1
i have thought maybe i would classify under ultradian/rapid cycle bipolar because my father, grandmother and great-grandfather suffered from bpd and my moods change over the course of hours to a couple of days at most.	distorted	1
she told me everyday if i kept being fat i'd get bullied and in my mind i always felt like she was my only bully.	distorted	1
i am a survivor of childhood abuse and have been suffering from violent daydreaming for more than 15 years.	distorted	1
over the years i have dealt with it by moving completely out of the picture due to the accompanying abuse and thinking it was just an alcohol problem.	distorted	1
i'm so sad, lonely and confused, and i feel like something is wrong with me and i should be ashamed that i can't find a boyfriend.	distorted	1
no matter wherever i go or to whosoever i talk to i keep feeling lonely, i keep feeling that i want to cry.	distorted	1
but i have no one to turn to… and no money to invest in serious counseling… so i don't know what to do.	distorted	1
i often think i am a failure but sometime in am cocky.	distorted	1
my parents know i cut but they said they only cared because it could result in something looking bad on them.	distorted	1
i have been in a relationship with a boy my age for about 3 years, i lost my virginity to him and have never been in a relationship with anyone else.	distorted	1
what might be wrong with me or causing this ignorance? can it ever be corrected? how? people accuse me of not caring & being insensitive even though i'm not.	distorted	1
my ex boyfriend died a couple years ago which led me into a spell of depression and i don't know if i ever made it out or if i'm just used to it.	distorted	1
i know this is perfectly normal and reasonable and not something he should even have to ask for, yet i completely freaked out, feeling really hurt and rejected.	distorted	1
i can't function anymore, everything scares me, i'm paranoid beyond belief, and keep waking up at night with panic attacks.	distorted	1
from new zealand: there's this boy i met only last year like in december? we had a thing but that was it i had no further feelings for him but that didn't stop him from stalking me and telling everyone that we go out.	distorted	1
he doesn't have a history of self harm or suicide attempts, or a history of harming others, or ever talk about these things.	distorted	1
i fantasize about murdering or torturing people that has wronged me, but i wont do it cuz i will get a criminal record .	distorted	1
i don't want to break up our family but i can feel myself becoming resentful and just avoiding him all together to avoid any confrontation.	distorted	1
i got it in my head that this is the one thing you are good at, don't ever lose or let them see you fail.	distorted	1
she makes snarky comments about what a brat i am, about how it's always my fault.	distorted	1
i enjoy the thought of jail, i don't know why but i do, i think it could be because i'm deadly afraid of change it scares me, so jail = no change, schedule, but i don't know.	distorted	1

the only time i argue with my husband is over her.	distorted	1
recently my girlfriend broke up with me after i told her all of my thoughts and feelings.	distorted	1
i fantasize about hurting and even killing people, though i would never do this in real life.	distorted	1
i never really feel like i connect with others and often feel like a misfit around other humans, like i simply don't belong with them.	distorted	1
i live with threats from my husband that if i tell of his people, then i have to leave his house.	distorted	1
i recently asked my parents if i could get a therapist, but i only mentioned stress because i thought they would be too worried if i mentioned depression, anxiety, or suicidal thoughts.	distorted	1
i am a very planning person and hate uncertainty and feel a high degree of responsibility for my family.	distorted	1
i just feel paranoid and on edge all the time during these episodes– and it only happens when i'm depressed.	distorted	1

every day i feel worse and worse and i don't want to be around anybody, but at the same time, want to be with someone.	distorted	1
it's been a continuing trend in my life, but i am just wondering if it is a normal reaction to not care (aside from feeling angry when i think about my past).	distorted	1
i freak out all of the time because i always think i'm contracting a deathly disease when i'm not.	distorted	1
he is a good man, and a man i want to marry, but i don't know how to marry a man that i can't sleep next or that lies to me about this.	distorted	1
but, i feel so tired of studying and just feeling lost and worthless.	distorted	1
i don't connect to anyone, the only time i feel anything is when i am thinking of my first kill and seeing someone die in my arms again.	distorted	1
the doctor took me off of it (this is a sleep doctor by the way) and explained that since i had a bad reaction to the lexapro that i may have bi-polar depression.	distorted	1
when the councilor asked if i had ever feared physical violence at home was kind of an aha moment.	distorted	1
i am still getting this horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach, even though both of them claim nothing has or will happen.	distorted	1
when ever i needed some support in any way from her she would tell me to stop being selfish and to this day i have a very hard time opening up to people because i feel like my problems don't matter.	distorted	1
a lot of the time i hear it when i'm alone and no one is there, which scares me.	distorted	1
but, i'm reluctant to distance myself from him, both because he interests me, and because i worry about what he might do.	distorted	1
she has only been to a doctor to prove her diagnoses right and to get anti- depressants and sleeping pills.	distorted	1
yelling makes me uncomfortable, and it never seems to solve anything, so i only do it when if feels like the only way to get attention–and then i feel horribly afterwards.	distorted	1

i began crying everyday thinking about my wedding and how its simplicty was lost in stupid things like what color the napkins should be and how large the cake should be.	distorted	1
i am never happy where ever i am.	distorted	1
i'm not sure if i have an actual anxiety disorder or if i'm just a naturally anxious person, but when i try to go to sleep, all i can focus on is the feeling in my stomach.	distorted	1
i am afraid that i am a killer and not a good person, and this has made me want to kill myself to avoid hurting someone else.	distorted	1
"my dad always thought i did in middle school because i dont put my lips to my fork when i eat i use my teeth to ""rake"" the food off instead and i always thought that was crazy."	distorted	1
i struggle with the issues of being gay, but being a christian, i feel it is a sin and therefore, i don't live the lifestyle.	distorted	1
when i talk to myself i will look in a mirror and i always feel as if i wasn't looking back at myself but at a different person as if their person in the mirror could reach out and touch me and if there is no mirror then i will look back in for.	distorted	1
i felt that i couldn't talk to him about anything, because he would get defensive and either not engage at all or get very angry.	distorted	1
i am so distraught, he is the most sweetest man i have ever met (or at least i thought he was) i thought he would never do anything like this.	distorted	1
my mom always tells me i am ungrateful and don't deserve anything.	distorted	1
i decided that i was being rude to everyone, mostly him so i decided we should leave.	distorted	1
anyway, on the night in question, i unknowingly triggered a flashback to trauma which occurred years before we met that she had never told me about.	distorted	1
i think scary thoughts sometime, it's been happening since i was a kid and ever since i had my daughter it's been worse.	distorted	1
however, my homesickness has nothing to do with missing my family and friends (not particularly), i just miss not being in university, it's incredibly stressful; i have a part-time job which causes me extreme anxiety.	distorted	1
my parents think i am a bad parent for wanting him to be there knowing what he did.	distorted	1
i want to make sure that he knows i sympathize with his insecurities but at the same time i cannot handle it when he attacks the fact i was with others before him.	non-distorted	0
i feel worthless, disgusting, fat and hideous.	distorted	1

i have often panic attacks, i vomited recently after a traumatic event and i can never walk away from my technology no matter how hard i try.	distorted	1
i have to roll over and curl up against the wall because my body is still freaking out.	distorted	1
i don't know why, i love cats and would never want to hurt one, but my mind just kept telling me to harm it.	distorted	1
i was never interested in the romance, instead, i would skip ahead to the scene where the ship sank and the passengers froze to death.	distorted	1
my understanding was that delusional people don't know they are delusional, but i am aware that all of this makes no sense, and i want it to stop.	distorted	1
now my obsessions are lowered and there is only one kind of fear that buggers me a lot.	distorted	1
and i am afraid to go to a real live person face to face because i am not so great at talking out loud.	distorted	1
at random times of the day -noon or night, there's never consistency- i will get a 'flash' or a 'clip' of myself moments before becoming seriously injured or what looks like could only result in premature death, in wherever my current environment is.	distorted	1
at first, we thought it was just normal married problems but when we got older we realized that every summer my mom's attitude flips and this time has been the worst.	distorted	1
i feel like he is a spoiled brat sometimes because he gets so mad when he doesn't get his way.	distorted	1
typing this out in struggling because i can't even function.	distorted	1
how could he know how it should be handled? was he pregnant? did he have to kill his child? it broke my heart and all he had to say about it was that i didn't handle it properly.	distorted	1
i can only sleep after i stay up so late that i exhaust myself completely and that's when some of my brain slows down.	distorted	1
i try my best but i can't control myself and i can't stop lying to my parents about even the stupidest things.	distorted	1

i even try to picture her in pain, or crying, to see if it would stir any emotion in me, but instead i feel nothing, like i have never loved her.	distorted	1

i try my best to avoid conflict, but go as far as inconveniencing myself to avoid inconveniencing others.	distorted	1
i completely panic.	distorted	1
i keep telling myself that there must be something else causing me to feel this way, because like i said, i don't seem to experience panic attacks quite the same as most people.	distorted	1
i have intense intrusive thoughts that keep me up every night (i haven't slept yet, it's 8am on the dot and i'm really unable to sleep) and sometimes the thoughts go as far that i think about harming myself or worse.	distorted	1
i'd like to go back to my therapist but feel like he'd think it was dumb (because i feel like it's dumb.	distorted	1
i think it's because i have seen to many scary movies and documentaries of serial killers.	distorted	1
i know that i don't eat as much as my family, but they are all overweight.	non-distorted	0
i thought about school shootings only wondering where i would get the gun.	distorted	1
also i often repeat random things to myself like words or phrases for a time as i feel if i say it out loud or to myself i will relieve some of my anxiety but it only makes it worse.	distorted	1
i mean i accept death as an inevitable but these were people close to me, shouldn't i be the least bit sad? i'm not sure what i should do.	distorted	1
when i went to school this one day i got told that i was stupid and pathetic because i didn`t take a phone away in one of the classes i was teaching.	distorted	1
but i was scared that what if i die and nothing gonna happen like all empytness and black screen but sometimes i thought myself maybe i will go heaven and there is god.	distorted	1
he enjoyed the whole thing very much, but i always thought it was gross and awkward.	distorted	1

i am unable to start a new relationship with another man because i am too needy and dependent.	distorted	1
hi, i'm pretty sure that my brother has always suffered from depression.	distorted	1
i'm scared to talk to my mom about it because i don't want her to think that i'm being dramatic.	distorted	1
i feel so guilty because i don't want my friends and family to feel upset or burdened by my problems and i really don't know what to do.	distorted	1
she is nothing like the person she used to be, and it's devastating.	distorted	1
but maybe that's the problem, i live for others and not myself? i just don't know what i should do or what i want to do about anything–school, career, relationships with others–my life.	distorted	1
the fact that i only feel aroused this way ever since i was a kid makes me mad, especially because it's not even associated with sex.	distorted	1
i've done everything from committing petty theft to hauling illegal substances in search of this feeling.	distorted	1
he still loves me and he knows we will be happy together, but he chose to give up on us … on our future together i feel devastated … hurt … empty and numb.	distorted	1

i often will ramble- what i want to say, what i think in my head, never comes out how i want it to- it never makes any sense i hate it! i don't know if we are real.	distorted	1
i feel like i'm making him out to be a bad person, which he isn't, but he just doesn't want to deal with difficult emotional stuff and so he'd rather ignore it.	distorted	1
she says things aren't and never have been right with him and just needs time to figure things out but doesn't want to ruin things with us.	distorted	1
"it's getting kind of hard to deal with because when i get in the ""empty"" state of mind i feel unmotivated and end up neglecting school work, chores, activities, everything."	distorted	1
i was in a bad car crash months ago, my mother came straight up to the hospital while my father just turned over in bed and slept.	distorted	1
this is nothing serious, but i thought i am over the anxiety of him being hurt or dying, he is recovering and with each day he is getting better.	distorted	1
after that happened, my mom decided i should still live in the same house despite him laughing while apologizing to me (since he did tried to stop my breathing).	distorted	1
i broke up with my boyfriend about 3 months ago (about a month after school started), and ever since then, i feel very awkward when talking to anyone besides the people i have known for two years.	distorted	1
we left with my mom more than once but we always came back even when i thought 'there is no way she'd go back after what he did this time'.	distorted	1
it seems to have come to pass that i have lost all ability to feel emotions, other than a certain amount of anxiety and self loathing.	distorted	1
"most people are afraid of going insane, and they think ""i'm not crazy!"" when they're in my place: lost, alone, depressed, suicidal, and self injuring."	distorted	1
i never kissed anyone and i feel shame because of it.	distorted	1
i tell him all the time that i will try to quit but i can't because i stay so nervous.	distorted	1
he has had violent out bursts, but only towards me, as far as i know.	distorted	1
i had no idea that i made such a lasting impression on her life and i'm restless because i don't know what i can do to make amends.	distorted	1
this i can say occurred because of my crumbling family life after my dad abandoned me and left me with my mother as a pre-teen.	distorted	1

we used to be relatively close and in the first few months she was just always angry at me or crying because of him and since my brothers went to university it's just been me and her.	distorted	1

i sometimes cry myself to sleep because i can't be with her full time.	distorted	1

it causes me a lot of issues in my job and my professional performance because i lack self-confidence and fear being judged.	distorted	1
i don't do anything to aggravate him, in fact i try to avoid him seeing me (since just seeing me aggravates him) but he would find me and abuse me for any or no reason at all.	distorted	1
i'm scared to talk about this with my therapist because i'm scared of what she might tell me.	distorted	1
i think she's going to be understanding and sympathetic like she always is but what if she isn't? i can't stop worrying about it.	distorted	1
she made sure he would never come back to our club or contact me again, which helped a lot, but i cant stop thinking about how stupid i was for letting myself do those things.	distorted	1

i chose to hide my struggle so never got tested for mood disorders.	distorted	1
also she has one labeled food journal but i didn't get to look at it because i didn't want to arouse suspicion for taking too long.	distorted	1
it got me panicking and later on i think that my feelings were exaggerated due to anxiety and there was nothing sexual there.	distorted	1
this didn't cause me to hate her at all as she did apologize and we eventually became closer.	distorted	1
it feels like no matter what i do to get better, i can't get away from people telling me they cut or are suicidal.	distorted	1
i'm always depressed when i'm not around my ex.	distorted	1

i'm 21 and i was raped almost two years ago and every since i have had this obsession with rape.	distorted	1
even from when i was young, she was always very violent when she was angry and she would break a lot of furniture but i thought that this was a normal adult behavior.	distorted	1
he really didn't, there were no bruisings and i know it was because i was going to do something much worst.	distorted	1
the thoughts eventually stopped and i went to the doctor and she diagnosed me with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and prescribed zoloft in which i didn't take due to my boyfriend saying that it will not help me but have me in this dazed out state of mind.	distorted	1

i am a 18 year old male who is very confused about what i want to do with my life.	distorted	1
i did come from an abusive home but nobody had been listening when i only spoke of the yelling and neglect and the hitting.	distorted	1
only my family knows my aversion of being around people ,but even then they don't know the extent of how i feel of just the thought of being around people, the fear that rises in the pit of my stomach ,and the feeling of becoming trapped, and not being able to breath as if someone is chocking me.	distorted	1

i was in such a bad condition that when my mother applied for disability on my behalf i was accepted immediately.	distorted	1
if i have to call someone or see them in person, i will put it off for weeks or even months just to avoid being in a situation that i am uncomfortable with.	distorted	1

firstly, i am a complete failure.	distorted	1
honestly, i started cutting myself because i was bored but it became very serious: now i have suicidal thoughts.	distorted	1
bottom line, i don't know how to handle all of this and it hurts.	distorted	1
should i just leave him? can he love at all? should i confront him? i have never openly asked him about his desires to kill because it scares me.	distorted	1
"in that session she told my partner that our communication would never be ""awesome"" she also told him that i would never be happy with him."	distorted	1

like i'm worthless, maybe broken or damaged beyond repair.	distorted	1
i am terrified of people talking to me or having to talk to people and it's a huge issue when it comes to my job.	distorted	1
so when i talked to my parents they said it was just because my hormones are all over the place, but would my hormones give me suicidal thoughts or wanting to cut.	distorted	1

i can't get over what i did, i feel depressed, and i feel like everything in my life is ruined because of this mistake.	distorted	1
i get very sad when this happens, because i would never say those things out loud, but it feels just as bad to think it.	distorted	1

i need to know if i should openly admit of being suicidal but can't do nothing about it because i can't do that to my only child.	distorted	1
can't we just live in peace? i have always considered running away, but i have never had enough courage to do so, under the fear that my mother will always end up finding me and scream at me and punish me.	distorted	1
the worst part is that that i had forgotten about my cousin then once when i was 17, the events flashedback but it was too late as i was now very attached to him as a brother.	distorted	1
i get the stiff feeling on the back of my head and have to divert me attention to my phone (which stops the shaking), i find it so hard to just walk normally on the street without pretending to be on my phone.	distorted	1
i am desperately seeking a job but no one will higher me because i have no work experience.	distorted	1
at one point we often laugh and talk together, when i want a hug she's the first person i'm going to, but at the same time she's the only person that i actually fell deep hatred towards.	distorted	1
i get angry over nothing.	distorted	1
i do care, i just don't know what to do or say in most situations, especially since he's always in physical pain and blames the stress that i'm causing him for that pain.	distorted	1
i never feel like i can say what i want because i'm scared he's going to react.	distorted	1

i'm 17 and i think i might be depressed, but i'm wondering if i really have to tell someone about it because i also am extremely shy.	distorted	1
i miss the times before we had children, saying this it feels me with guilt because i wouldn't see my life without my children now.	distorted	1
i should die … stuff like that .	distorted	1
i couldn't even go out to dinner with family because i was so paranoid that i couldn't sit still.	distorted	1

"she is very uncomfortable showing her emotions, to the point where she has never said ""i love you"" to me, and my father sometimes forces her to say it to him."	distorted	1
i'm more prone to crying out of nowhere or at the slightest mention of something even remotely upsetting to me.	distorted	1
i want to give up and just live alone so badly, but my therapist insists that i should find a social life.	distorted	1
even some co-workers ignore the situation, my own boss doesn't even ask how i am, ever.	distorted	1
while i love him and genuinely want to grow old with him, i am fearful that this is not intelligent of me to do, nor practical to marry someone who is bipolar and seeking no treatment.	distorted	1
i have been thinking to do this for some time but never had the courage so here goes; for the past time i have been feeling so unloved and worthless.	distorted	1
the only thing stopping me from hurting others is getting my satisfaction from illegal videos online, on gruesome websites such as 'bestgore.	distorted	1
i have to force myself to eat and i'm constantly worried about myself and my health and just do not enjoy my life anymore.	distorted	1
i hate being touched, don't care about others feelings or what they are doing, will always assume i am being lied to.	distorted	1
i can't stop seeing myself as a horrible person and a weird sicko.	distorted	1
i was at a very very low point in my life after that breakup, i felt worthless and stupid.	distorted	1
it also makes me feel so aware of everything, even my awareness, i want to get outside of myself, but i can't hide from this hyper-awareness of my consciousness so it makes me even more freaked out (i feel trapped, condemned to listen to my inner voice for eternity).	distorted	1
i swore i would never cheat on my husband because i never forgave myself for cheating on him with the married guy.	distorted	1
i haven't even mentioned that my medications and behavioral therapies have done absolutely nothing to help my ocd.	distorted	1
i have no one to talk to and i feel like my mind is just full with different problems.	distorted	1
that i should just die.	distorted	1
i have no motivation for school and i can't concentrate no matter how hard i try to.	distorted	1
after that i have been getting c's and no matter what i do my mom still treats me badly.	distorted	1
he does not like doing most things that i do, he thinks i'm silly, and sometimes i feel like he doesn't take me seriously.	distorted	1
i became a very jealous person during the course of the relationship, but had never felt jealous before he began hurting me.	distorted	1
but now i am a little older, and i regret deeply what i did in the past.	distorted	1
so i did, but in the mist of all that i fell into a depression and neglected to tell her cause i thought it will make me seem weak.	distorted	1
i am writing cause i want to understand what is wrong with me and if i will ever have a normal life.	distorted	1
anyway i got over it but from long ago i always talk to myself it's something usual for me and i think it's normal but what made it stop being normal was when i started thinking that i have an other me inside of myself who wants to get me and hurt me and do all it can just to break me.	distorted	1
should i go to a doctors for depression ,anxiety? or should i not take it to serious? i feel lost.	distorted	1
i got very upset, and it caused us to argue, and this arguing caused him to walk out, and we didn't talk for 2 days, and he admits that the night he left my house, he went to her house and stayed all night bc he'd had a few beers.	distorted	1
i am so embarrassed because i frequently find myself fighting back tears in public.	distorted	1
i was always questioning my existence and i had suicidal thoughts.	distorted	1
"i also feel extreme anxiety and suffer panic attacks any time i have to attend a social event, only because i hate my body and i think everyone on the street is looking at me and saying ""oh my god she is so fat, look at her"" and etc."	distorted	1
a few years ago every day i contemplated life without me and thought about different ways of killing myself but i talked myself out of it.	distorted	1
and i think i must have been a bad child because i was hit a lot, but other than not participating in physical things, i don't remember being bad.	distorted	1
i thought i had depression and anxiety because i had many of the symptoms, but lately i've been doubting that (because of intrusive thoughts).	distorted	1
he insulted me,said things to me that one would not even say to their worst enemy.	distorted	1
i have sought to fill that void through relationships, but all have failed except the one i am currently in.	distorted	1
he gets mean and insults me and later he becomes upset because i'm upset about it and;i should know not to take anything seriously that he says when he's angry.	distorted	1
i was more depressed than i had ever been in my life.	distorted	1
i have too many problems and i don't know how to deal with all of them.	distorted	1
my ex is a very lonely woman and is willing to move to another country with this woman that she has only known a couple of weeks.	distorted	1
do you know what might have happened to me? is this some sort of screwed-up sexual thing? it doesn't feel like it, but i can't think of any other reason i would have urges to kill people of such a specific subset.	distorted	1
now i catch myself over eating when i'm stressed, i am always stressed.	distorted	1
it's very hard to explain it in writing, but it feels uncontrolable when i start to feel the anxiety and apprehension.	distorted	1
its getting to the point that my friend gets frustrated with me because i never want to hang out and just want to be alone.	distorted	1
but then you said that you have never had the kind of friends you long for.	non-distorted	0

your self-esteem depends on whether you behave in a way that you believe is right and how you contribute to making the world a better place.	non-distorted	0
