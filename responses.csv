i have failed as a father., Distorted.

The sentence "I have failed as a father" can be considered as having a cognitive distortion, particularly the "all-or-nothing" thinking or polarized thinking distortion where situations are perceived in black and white categories. In this case, the person is categorizing themselves as a complete failure as a father, which may not accurately reflect reality.

The sentence "I am so unlucky. Nothing good ever happens for me" contains cognitive distortions known as "all-or-nothing thinking" and "overgeneralization." These distortions can cause the individual to perceive reality inaccurately, leading to negative emotions and beliefs about themselves.

her sister is a very difficult woman who talks all the time. she expects us to just take care of her., Distorted.

The sentence "her sister is a very difficult woman who talks all the time. she expects us to just take care of her" contains cognitive distortions known as "labeling" and "mind reading." Labeling refers to the oversimplified negative generalization about a person, while mind reading is assuming we know what others are thinking without sufficient evidence. The sentence assumes that the sister's behavior is difficult and expects to be taken care of without verifying her actual thoughts or expectations.

i don't have the ability to accomplish this task, i'm not even going to try., Distorted. The sentence "I don't have the ability to accomplish this task, I'm not even going to try" exhibits the cognitive distortion of "Disqualifying the Positive," where an individual dismisses their potential abilities or successes. In this case, the person is implying that they are incapable of completing the task without even attempting it, which can reinforce negative self-perceptions and hinder progress towards overcoming depression.

i don't want to tell her no because she will be so disappointed and she'll be angry with me., Distorted
i am too old to learn another skill., Distorted.

The sentence "I am too old to learn another skill" contains a cognitive distortion known as "Labeling and Mislabeling." This occurs when someone attaches a negative label to themselves or others based on little evidence, which can lead to an inaccurate perception of reality. In this case, the speaker is labeling themselves as being "too old" to learn a new skill, which may not necessarily be accurate. It's important to note that people of any age can learn new skills and abilities with dedication, time, and effort. Therefore, the sentence can be considered distorted.
