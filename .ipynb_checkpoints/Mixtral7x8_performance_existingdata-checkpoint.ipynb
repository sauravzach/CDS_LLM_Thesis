Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. I need your help to detect the presence of CDS in some sentences. Any slight of CDS presence should be considered as distorted even the smallest ones. Does the following sentence contain a cognitive distortion: \u001b[39m\u001b[38;5;132;01m{\u001b[39;00msentence\u001b[38;5;132;01m}\u001b[39;00m\u001b[38;5;124m?
