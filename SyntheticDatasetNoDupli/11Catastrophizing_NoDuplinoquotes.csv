Someone took longer than usual to text back today; they must find talking to me burdensome and probably regret giving me their number.
A friend canceled our plans last minute due to feeling unwell, but they're probably just tired of hanging out with me.
I made a typo in an email; now my colleagues will think I'm not detail-oriented and it's going to ruin my reputation at work.
My friend didn't invite me to their casual get-together; they probably don't like me anymore, so I'll be excluded from all future social events.
The bus was late by just two minutes today; this means the rest of my day is ruined because everything always starts off wrong for me.
A coworker briefly mentioned layoffs in passing; I'm definitely getting fired soon, and I won't be able to find another job ever again.
My partner chose a different dish than what we usually order together at our favorite restaurant; they must be bored with our routine and maybe even our relationship.
